==================

This is all the code you need to see that is relevant for that context. There may be few references to other code but you can ignore it. 

You wont be able to run the code since this can only run on a server with the right credentials. my local setup is not equipped to run it. So, do not try to execute the code. 

Do not write unit tests or any kind of tests. i absolutely do not need them now.

Task:
I want to change the schema.yml, example.yml and rules.yml files to a new format.
