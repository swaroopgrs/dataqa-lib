IMPORTANT GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS:

*   Every response must include a `<reasoning>` section that explains the logic and steps taken to address the query. This section should be clear and detail the thought process.
*   Every response must include a `<code>` section that contains the Snowflake SQL code generated to solve the query. Enclose this section with `<code>` and `</code>` tags.
*   Use uppercase for SQL keywords to maintain consistency and readability.
*   Ensure that both `<reasoning>` and `<code>` tags are present in every response to facilitate parsing and interpretation.


EXAMPLES:

Q: What are the Transaction divisions associated with Starbucks?
A:
<reasoning>
To find the transaction divisions associated with Starbucks, we need to:

1.  **Identify Active Transaction Divisions**:
    - Filter the `EIS_D_CUST_PORTFOLIO` table to include only active transaction divisions (`cust_stat = 'A'`).
    - Ensure that the `cust_type_cd` is 'TD' to focus on transaction divisions.
2.  **Identify Starbucks**:
    - Use the `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name` to identify Starbucks by matching names that include 'Starbucks' using a case-insensitive `LIKE` query.
3.  **Select Relevant Columns**:
    - Select `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id` as `comp_id`, `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name` as `comp_name`, `cust_extl_id` as `td_id`, and `cust_name` as `td_name`.
4.  **Group Results**:
    - Group by `comp_id`, `comp_name`, `td_name`, `td_id` to get unique combinations.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT
    ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id AS comp_id,
    ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name AS comp_name,
    cust_extl_id AS td_id,
    cust_name AS td_name
FROM EIS_D_CUST_PORTFOLIO
WHERE cust_stat = 'A'
AND cust_type_cd = 'TD'
AND LOWER(ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name) LIKE '%starbucks%'
GROUP BY comp_id, comp_name, td_name, td_id;
</code>


Q: Give me all companies that are active.
A:
<reasoning>
To list all active companies, we need to:

1.  **Filter Active Companies**:
    - Use the `cust_stat` column to filter for active companies (`cust_stat = 'A'`).
2.  **Select Unique Companies**:
    - Select distinct `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id` as `comp_id` and `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name` as `comp_name` to get a list of unique active companies.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT DISTINCT ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id AS comp_id, ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name AS comp_name
FROM EIS_D_CUST_PORTFOLIO
WHERE cust_stat = 'A';
</code>


Q: What are all the companies that are in the US?
A:
<reasoning>
To find all companies located in the United States, we need to:

1.  **Filter by Country Code**:
    - Use the `cust_country_cd` column to filter for companies in the USA (`cust_country_cd = 'USA'`).
2.  **Filter Active Companies**:
    - Ensure that the companies are active by checking `cust_stat = 'A'`.
3.  **Select Unique Companies**:
    - Select distinct `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id` as `comp_id` and `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name` as `comp_name` to get a list of unique companies in the US.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT DISTINCT ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_extl_id AS comp_id, ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name AS comp_name
FROM EIS_D_CUST_PORTFOLIO
WHERE cust_stat = 'A' AND cust_country_cd = 'USA';
</code>


Q: What is the total gross sales for Starbucks for the month of September 2024?
A:
<reasoning>
To calculate the total gross sales for Starbucks in September 2024, we need to:

1.  **Identify Starbucks**:
    - Use the `ownrshp_comp_lvl_1_name` to identify Starbucks by matching names that include 'Starbucks' using a case-insensitive `LIKE` query. (Assuming `co_id` links to company)
2.  **Filter by Dates**:
    - Use the `subm_dt_yyyymm` column to filter for transactions in September 2024 (`subm_dt_yyyymm = '202409'`).
3.  **Aggregate Sales Data**:
    - Sum the `gross_sales_usd` and `gross_sales_units` to get the total gross sales in USD and units for the specified period.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT
   subm_dt_yyyymm AS month,
   SUM(gross_sales_usd) AS total_gross_sales_usd,
   SUM(gross_sales_units) AS total_gross_sales_units
FROM PROD_BD_TM_FLAT_V3
WHERE LOWER(co_id) LIKE '%starbucks%'
AND subm_dt_yyyymm = '202409'
GROUP BY month;
</code>


Q: Give me a breakdown of gross sales by day.
A:
<reasoning>
To provide a breakdown of gross sales by day, we need to:

1.  **Group by Day**:
    - Use the `subm_dt` column to group the sales data by each day.
2.  **Aggregate Sales Data**:
    - Sum the `gross_sales_usd` and `gross_sales_units` to get the total gross sales in USD and units for each day.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT
    subm_dt AS day,
    SUM(gross_sales_usd) AS total_gross_sales_usd,
    SUM(gross_sales_units) AS total_gross_sales_units
FROM PROD_BD_TM_FLAT_V3
GROUP BY day;
</code>


Q: Give me a breakdown of gross sales by Method of Payment for the month of September 2024.
A:
<reasoning>
To provide a breakdown of gross sales by method of payment for September 2024, we need to:

    - Use the `subm_dt_yyyymm` column to filter for transactions in September 2024 (`subm_dt_yyyymm = '202409'`).
2.  **Group by Method of Payment**:
    - Use the `mop_cd` column to group the sales data by each method of payment.
3.  **Aggregate Sales Data**:
    - Sum the `gross_sales_usd` and `gross_sales_units` to get the total gross sales in USD and units for each method of payment.
</reasoning>
<code>
SELECT
    mop_cd AS method_of_payment,
    SUM(gross_sales_usd) AS total_gross_sales_usd,
    SUM(gross_sales_units) AS total_gross_sales_units
