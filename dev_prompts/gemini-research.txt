Design and Architecture Specification for the dataqa Library: A Config-Driven Framework for Natural Language Database InteractionI. IntroductionThis document outlines the technical design and architectural specification for dataqa, a Python library aimed at facilitating natural language querying, analysis, and visualization of data residing in various database systems or accessible via APIs. The primary goal of dataqa is to provide a flexible, modular, and configuration-driven framework that empowers users to build sophisticated data interaction workflows or autonomous agent systems tailored to their specific needs.The core problem addressed is the translation of natural language requests into actionable operations across three key stages: retrieving data (via SQL generation, API calls, or function execution), analyzing the retrieved data (through code generation or predefined functions), and visualizing the results (similarly via code generation or predefined functions).A central challenge in designing such a library is achieving modularity while supporting two distinct operational paradigms: predefined Workflows (orchestrated via code) and dynamic Agents (orchestrated by LLMs). Components must be designed for reuse in both contexts. Furthermore, the library must be extensible to accommodate different agent frameworks (initially LangGraph, with potential future support for CrewAI, Autogen, etc.) without requiring significant refactoring. This necessitates careful abstraction design.Another critical aspect is decoupling the library from direct database access. Instead of managing numerous database connectors, dataqa will interface with an external, user-provided code execution API. This design introduces complexities regarding communication protocols, asynchronous execution, and handling the feedback loop required for iterative code refinement based on execution errors.This specification details the proposed architecture, component design, interface definitions, configuration system, and development standards to address these challenges and guide the implementation of the dataqa library.II. Core Architectural PrinciplesThe design of dataqa is founded on several key software engineering principles to ensure robustness, maintainability, and flexibility.

A. Modularity through Dependency Injection (DI): The library will heavily utilize the Dependency Injection design pattern. DI involves providing dependencies (like configuration objects, LLM clients, or other components) to a class or function from an external source, rather than having the component create them internally.1 This approach promotes loose coupling between components, making the system more modular.3 By decoupling the creation and provision of dependencies, components become easier to test in isolation by injecting mock dependencies.1 Furthermore, DI enhances flexibility, allowing different implementations of a dependency (e.g., different LLM providers, different execution API clients) to be swapped easily, often through configuration changes.3 Python's dynamic nature makes DI implementation straightforward, potentially leveraging frameworks like dependency-injector for managing DI containers and configurations.2 This aligns with the principle of Inversion of Control (IoC), where the control over dependency creation is shifted from the component to an external entity (the container or framework).2


B. Configurability via Pydantic: All aspects of the library's behavior, including LLM selection, component settings, agent/workflow definitions, context sources, and external API details, will be managed through a robust configuration system. Pydantic, specifically its BaseSettings feature, will be employed for defining, validating, and loading configurations.9 Pydantic allows for the creation of clearly defined, type-hinted configuration schemas, enabling static analysis and early detection of misconfigurations.11 It supports loading settings from environment variables, .env files, and default values, providing flexibility in deployment.9 Its validation capabilities ensure that configuration values adhere to expected types and constraints, reducing runtime errors.11 Nested configuration structures can be effectively managed, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the library's settings.10


C. Extensibility via Adapters: To support multiple agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen, etc.) without tightly coupling the core components to any single framework, an Adapter pattern will be implemented. Core functionalities will be encapsulated in generic components. Adapters will then translate the interface of these generic components into the specific format required by each agent framework (e.g., LangGraph nodes, CrewAI tools). This allows the core logic to remain independent, facilitating the addition of support for new frameworks by simply implementing a new adapter.14 This promotes modularity and adheres to the principle of designing for change.


D. Loose Coupling: The combination of DI, configuration-driven design, and the Adapter pattern contributes to overall loose coupling within the system.1 Components have minimal dependencies on the concrete implementations of other components or external systems. The separation of code generation (within dataqa) and code execution (via the external API) is a prime example of loose coupling, isolating the library from the specifics of the user's execution environment. High cohesion within components (grouping related functionality) and low coupling between them are key goals.4

III. Agent/Workflow Abstraction LayerTo enable components to function seamlessly within both predefined workflows and dynamic agent systems, and to facilitate switching between different agent frameworks, a carefully designed abstraction layer is necessary.

A. Rationale: Agent frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and Autogen employ different concepts for defining agents, tools, state, and orchestration.15 LangGraph uses graph-based structures and explicit state management.15 CrewAI focuses on role-based agents collaborating in "crews".15 Autogen emphasizes conversational agents and flexible interaction patterns.15 Pydantic AI offers simpler tool definitions, often used alongside other frameworks.21 A common abstraction is required to allow dataqa components (Querying, Analysis, Visualization) to be used consistently across these diverse paradigms without embedding framework-specific logic within the components themselves.


B. Common Component Interface (DataQAComponent): A base class or interface will define the contract for all core functional components. This interface standardizes how components are executed and how they expose necessary metadata for integration.
Pythonfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Type, Any, Dict

class DataQAComponent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, input_data: BaseModel, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> BaseModel | tuple]:
        """
        Executes the component's logic.
        Accepts validated input data and the current execution state.
        Returns validated output data, and optionally an updated state dictionary.
        """
        pass

    # Optional: Methods for describing the component (for agent tool usage)
    def get_description(self) -> str:
        """Returns a natural language description of what the component does."""
        # Default implementation or abstract method
        return self.__doc__ or self.__class__.__name__

    def get_input_schema(self) -> Type:
        """Returns the Pydantic model defining the expected input structure."""
        # To be implemented by subclasses, potentially introspecting execute signature
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_output_schema(self) -> Type:
        """Returns the Pydantic model defining the output structure."""
        # To be implemented by subclasses
        raise NotImplementedError

This interface ensures that each component has a standardized execution method and can provide metadata (description, input/output schemas) necessary for agent frameworks to use them as tools.


C. Adapter Layer: Specific adapters will bridge the gap between the DataQAComponent interface and the target agent framework.

LangGraph Adapter: This adapter will wrap DataQAComponent instances, making them usable as nodes within a LangGraph graph.14 It will handle the mapping between the component's Pydantic input/output schemas and LangGraph's state dictionary. If a component needs to influence the workflow dynamically, the adapter could potentially emit information used by LangGraph's conditional edges, although primary routing logic often resides in the graph definition itself. LangGraph's strength in managing complex, stateful workflows makes it a suitable initial target.15
Future Adapters (CrewAI, Autogen, Pydantic AI): Subsequent adapters will map DataQAComponent instances to concepts like CrewAI Tools or Tasks 16, Autogen's agent functions or skills 19, or Pydantic AI tools.17 Each adapter must handle the specific integration requirements and data transformations for its respective framework. For instance, a CrewAI adapter might register the component as a tool available to a specific agent role.



D. State Management: The DataQAComponent interface includes a state dictionary in its execute method signature. This allows components to access and potentially modify shared information during execution (e.g., intermediate results, user context). The specific agent framework adapter is responsible for populating this dictionary from the framework's native state mechanism (like LangGraph's graph state 15) before calling execute and updating the framework's state with any modifications returned by the component.


E. Implications of Abstraction: Creating a universal abstraction layer inevitably involves trade-offs. While it enables framework interchangeability and component reuse, it might obscure or prevent the direct use of highly specialized features unique to a particular framework.14 For example, intricate graph manipulation capabilities in LangGraph or specific conversational patterns in Autogen might not map cleanly onto the generic DataQAComponent interface. Attempting to encompass every possible feature would make the abstraction overly complex. Therefore, the abstraction should concentrate on the core execution contract (input, output, state, metadata). Advanced, framework-specific configurations or interactions should be managed outside the core component logic, potentially within the adapter implementation or the workflow/agent definition configured by the user. The primary goal is the reusability of the core Querying, Analysis, and Visualization logic.

IV. Component DesignThe dataqa library will be composed of distinct, reusable components conforming to the DataQAComponent interface.

A. Data Querying Component: This is the most critical component, responsible for translating natural language into executable code to retrieve data.

1. Input: Accepts a natural language query, along with configuration specifying context sources (schema, examples, rules), external execution API details, and LLM settings. Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. NLQ Rewriting: Before generating code or even retrieving context, the initial natural language query may need refinement. This step aims to improve clarity, resolve ambiguities, and format the query for optimal LLM comprehension.22 Simple prompts asking an LLM to rewrite a query often prove insufficient.22 More sophisticated techniques involve providing specific guidance. This could include incorporating predefined Natural Language Rewrite Rules (NLR2s) as textual hints within the prompt 22 or using database-sensitive prompts that leverage schema information or statistics.23 Another approach might involve decomposing complex sentences into simpler, atomic units before processing.28 The specific rewriting strategy should be configurable.
3. Context Retrieval (RAG Strategy): This step employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles to fetch relevant contextual information based on the (potentially rewritten) query. This context is crucial for enabling the LLM to generate accurate, database-specific code.29 The necessary context includes:

Database Schema: Detailed information about tables (names, descriptions), columns (names, descriptions, data types), relationships, and potentially representative sample values.31
Examples: Curated pairs of natural language queries and their corresponding correct code snippets (SQL, API calls, etc.). These serve as few-shot demonstrations for the LLM, guiding it towards the correct syntax and patterns.28 Providing reasoning alongside examples can further enhance understanding.
Business Rules: Textual descriptions of domain-specific logic, constraints, calculations, or terminology relevant to the database schema and query interpretation.34 Including business context has been shown to significantly improve NLQ-to-SQL accuracy.35
The retrieval mechanism typically involves storing embeddings of these context assets (schema descriptions, example queries, rule snippets) in a vector database.29 The incoming natural language query is also embedded, and a similarity search (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)) retrieves the most relevant context chunks.29 Effective chunking strategies are important for large documents or schema descriptions.36 Hybrid search, combining vector similarity with traditional keyword matching, might improve relevance in some cases.36 An alternative, particularly for highly relational schemas, could be graph-based RAG, representing schema elements, rules, and their relationships as nodes and edges in a graph database.29


4. Prompt Composition: The (rewritten) query and the retrieved context (schema, examples, rules) are assembled into a final prompt for the code-generating LLM. This composition process should utilize configurable prompt templates. The prompt must clearly articulate the task (e.g., "Generate a Snowflake SQL query"), provide all necessary context in a structured manner, and specify the desired output format.31 Best practices include:

Representing the database schema clearly, perhaps using standard CREATE TABLE syntax or a simplified structured format.31 Include table and column descriptions.31
Incorporating the most relevant retrieved few-shot examples.28 Studies suggest that selecting examples based on similarity (e.g., using Jaccard similarity) to the input query yields better results than random selection.28
Adding retrieved business rules as explicit instructions or constraints.
Clearly specifying the target code dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL SQL, Python function call syntax).
Using unambiguous instructions and potentially delimiters to structure the prompt.31


5. Code Generation: The composed prompt is sent to the configured LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, specialized models like Code Llama 32). The LLM processes the prompt and generates the corresponding code snippet.
6. Output: The primary output is the generated code snippet. Optionally, the component might also output metadata like the reasoning trace (if provided by the LLM) or a confidence score. Output structured via a Pydantic model.
7. Context vs. Prompt Length Consideration: A critical balance must be struck during context retrieval and prompt composition. Providing comprehensive context (detailed schema, numerous examples, extensive rules) is generally beneficial for accuracy.31 However, LLMs have finite context window limits. Overloading the prompt with excessive or irrelevant information can dilute the focus, increase processing time and cost, and potentially degrade performance.25 Effective RAG requires retrieving only the most pertinent information. This highlights the importance of the retrieval mechanism's precision. Techniques like filtering or re-ranking retrieved results 37 or applying schema relevance filtering 28 might be necessary to ensure only the most valuable context elements are included in the final prompt, dynamically adjusting based on query complexity and context size.



B. Data Analysis Component:

1. Input: Accepts data retrieved by the Querying component (e.g., in a structured format like a list of dictionaries or potentially a pandas DataFrame if standardized) and an analysis instruction (either natural language or a predefined function identifier). Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. Functionality: Provides two modes of operation:

Code Generation: Generates analysis code (e.g., Python code using libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy) based on a natural language request. This requires the LLM to understand the structure of the input data.
Pre-built Functions: Executes predefined, reusable analysis functions (e.g., calculating summary statistics, performing time-series decomposition, applying specific data transformations) selected via configuration or inferred from the natural language request.


3. Interface: Conforms to the DataQAComponent interface, accepting data and analysis instructions, returning processed data or analysis results.
4. Output: Analysis results, which could be transformed data, statistical summaries, textual interpretations, or other derived information. Output structured via a Pydantic model.



C. Data Visualization Component:

1. Input: Accepts data (typically from the Querying or Analysis step) and a visualization instruction (natural language or predefined function ID). Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. Functionality: Similar to the Analysis component, offers two modes:

Code Generation: Generates visualization code (e.g., using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or other plotting libraries) based on a natural language request and the input data structure.
Pre-built Functions: Executes predefined plotting functions (e.g., generate a standard bar chart, line plot, scatter matrix) selected via configuration or inferred from the request.


3. Interface: Conforms to the DataQAComponent interface, accepting data and visualization instructions.
4. Output: A visualization artifact. This could be a plot object from a library, image data (e.g., PNG bytes), or a structured representation like a JSON specification for a JavaScript charting library (e.g., Vega-Lite). Output structured via a Pydantic model.



D. Component Reusability (Agents vs. Workflows): The design explicitly supports using these components in both orchestration modes.

Workflows: In a predefined workflow (likely configured as a sequence or graph), the orchestration logic directly invokes the execute method of the configured components in the specified order, passing data and state between them.
Agents: In an agent-based system, an LLM-powered agent (like the Supervisor agent detailed later) utilizes the metadata provided by the DataQAComponent interface (get_description, get_input_schema, get_output_schema). The agent uses this information to understand what each component (now acting as a "tool") does and decides which tool to invoke next. The framework's adapter layer handles the actual invocation of the component's execute method based on the agent's decision.


V. External Code Execution API InterfaceA crucial design decision is to decouple dataqa from the actual execution of generated code. This is achieved by defining a clear interface for an external API that users must provide. dataqa generates code (SQL, Python) and sends it to this API; the API executes it in the user's environment and returns the results or errors.

A. Purpose: This interface acts as a contract 39 between dataqa and the user's data infrastructure. It allows dataqa to remain agnostic to specific databases, connection methods, authentication mechanisms, or execution environments. Users implement an API endpoint conforming to this specification, which handles the interaction with their specific data sources (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, internal function registry).


B. Communication Pattern: Given that database queries or data processing code can potentially run for extended periods, and the need for an iterative refinement loop based on execution feedback, an asynchronous communication pattern is strongly recommended over a simple synchronous REST API. Synchronous calls can lead to timeouts 40 and make handling long-running tasks difficult. Asynchronous patterns better support non-blocking operations and feedback mechanisms.41


PatternProsConsComplexity (Client/Server)Suitability for dataqaSynchronous RESTSimple to implement initially; well-understood standard.39Blocking; prone to timeouts for long tasks 40; awkward feedback loop.Low/LowPoor (due to long tasks & refinement needs)Async REST + PollingNon-blocking; handles long tasks 42; standard HTTP methods.Polling adds latency; requires state management (job ID).Medium/MediumGood (Recommended) - Balances features & complexityWebSocketsReal-time, bidirectional communication; efficient for status updates.More complex state management; persistent connection needed.Medium/MediumViable Alternative - Good for real-time feedbackMessage Queue (e.g., Kafka)Highly decoupled 40; scalable; supports complex workflows.Adds significant infrastructure overhead; potentially overkill.40High/HighOverkill (unless user already uses MQs extensively)
**Recommendation:** An asynchronous REST API utilizing HTTP `202 Accepted` responses [42] is the recommended approach. The initial request submits the code for execution and receives a job ID. `dataqa` then polls a status endpoint using this ID to retrieve the final results or error information. This pattern effectively handles long-running tasks and provides a clear mechanism for retrieving outcomes.


C. Interface Specification (Asynchronous REST Example):

1. Submit Job Endpoint (POST /execute):

Request Body: A JSON object containing the code to execute, its type, and any necessary context.
JSON{
  "code_type": "sql" | "python_func" | "python_api",
  "code": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE country = 'US';",
  "context": {
    "session_id": "user123_session",
    "required_libraries": ["pandas"]
  }
}


Response (Success): 202 Accepted. The response body includes a unique identifier for the submitted job.
JSON{ "job_id": "abc-123-xyz-789" }


Response (Error): Standard HTTP errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request for invalid input, 500 Internal Server Error for execution environment issues).


2. Get Job Status/Result Endpoint (GET /status/{job_id}):

Path Parameter: job_id obtained from the /execute response.
Response (Pending/Running): Indicates the job is still processing. Progress information is optional.
JSON{ "status": "pending" }
// or
{ "status": "running", "progress": 0.5 }


Response (Success): Indicates successful execution. Includes the results (format depends on code_type, e.g., list of dictionaries for SQL) and any relevant logs.
JSON{
  "status": "success",
  "results":,
  "logs": ["Query executed successfully."]
}


Response (Error): Indicates execution failed. Includes a structured error message, error type (e.g., SyntaxError, RuntimeError, PermissionError), and logs.
JSON{
  "status": "error",
  "error_message": "Table 'users_typo' not found",
  "error_type": "DatabaseError",
  "logs": ["Execution failed at line 1..."]
}


Response (Not Found): 404 Not Found if the job_id is invalid.





D. Data Formats: JSON should be used for all request and response bodies. Clear schemas should be defined (ideally using Pydantic models that can be shared as part of dataqa's documentation or helper utilities) to ensure consistency.


E. Error Handling & Feedback Loop: The ability to handle errors and refine code is critical. The external API must return detailed, structured error information.43 When dataqa receives an error status from the /status/{job_id} endpoint, the Data Querying component (or a dedicated error-handling module/agent) needs to:

Parse the error_message and error_type.
Attempt to diagnose the issue (e.g., syntax error in generated code, runtime error like invalid table name, permission issue).
Formulate a correction strategy. This might involve modifying the original NLQ, adjusting prompt parameters, or directly instructing the LLM to fix the generated code based on the error message. This mirrors counterexample-guided refinement techniques seen in query rewriting 22 and iterative code refinement based on execution feedback.44
Generate corrected code using the LLM.
Resubmit the corrected code via the /execute endpoint.
This iterative loop continues until execution succeeds or a retry limit is reached.



F. Security: While the implementation of the API server resides in the user's environment, dataqa should provide guidance on security best practices, such as using HTTPS, implementing proper authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens passed via configuration), and performing input validation on the server side.39 dataqa needs secure mechanisms (like Pydantic's SecretStr and environment variable loading) to handle credentials required to authenticate with the user's API endpoint.10


G. API Contract Flexibility Consideration: Defining a rigid API specification ensures predictability for dataqa.39 However, users might possess pre-existing internal systems for code execution that don't match this exact contract. Forcing users to build a specific adapter API could be a barrier to adoption. An alternative or supplementary approach is to define a Python adapter interface within dataqa. Users could implement this interface (a Python class with methods like submit_job and get_status) directly in their environment. dataqa could then be configured to use this Python adapter instead of the default REST API client, allowing direct calls to the user's execution logic without requiring a network hop or a specific API structure. This aligns well with the Dependency Injection principle, offering greater flexibility.

VI. Multi-Agent System OrchestrationFor scenarios requiring dynamic decision-making and coordination between the core functionalities (Querying, Analysis, Visualization), a multi-agent system architecture is appropriate.

A. Architecture Choice: A Hierarchical Supervisor pattern is recommended.14 In this pattern, a central Supervisor agent coordinates the activities of specialized subordinate agents. This structure aligns well with the sequential nature of the overall task (Query → Analyze → Visualize) and provides centralized control over the workflow, state management, and task delegation. Compared to a fully networked architecture where any agent can talk to any other, the supervisor model offers simpler control flow and communication management for this problem domain.14


B. Agent Roles:

1. Supervisor Agent: Acts as the orchestrator.

Responsibilities: Receives the initial user request (natural language query and overall goal). Decomposes the high-level task into logical steps (e.g., "First, query the data for X," "Next, analyze the results to find Y," "Finally, visualize Z").46 Manages the overall state, including intermediate data results and conversation history. Determines which specialized agent to invoke for each step based on the current state and task decomposition.46 Receives outputs from specialized agents, potentially asking for clarification or deciding the next step. Compiles the final response or visualization for the user.46
Implementation: Likely implemented as an LLM equipped with "tools" representing the specialized agents. The LLM uses its reasoning capabilities to plan and delegate [14 (tool-calling supervisor)].


2. Data Querying Agent: Focuses exclusively on data retrieval.

Responsibilities: Receives a specific query task (in natural language) from the Supervisor. Executes the full Data Querying component logic (Section IV.A): NLQ rewriting, RAG context retrieval, prompt composition, LLM code generation. Interacts with the External Code Execution API via the defined interface (Section V) to run the generated code. Manages the error handling and iterative refinement loop for code execution errors. Returns the structured data results (or an error state) back to the Supervisor.
Implementation: This agent encapsulates the complex logic of the Data Querying component. It might internally use an LLM (e.g., ReAct style) or be implemented as a more deterministic workflow (potentially a LangGraph subgraph itself) exposed as a single tool to the Supervisor.


3. Data Analysis Agent: Focuses on data analysis tasks.

Responsibilities: Receives data (from the Querying Agent via the Supervisor) and analysis instructions (either natural language or a structured request) from the Supervisor. Executes the Data Analysis component logic (Section IV.B), either generating analysis code (potentially interacting with the Execution API if needed) or running pre-built analysis functions. Returns the analysis results (transformed data, summaries, insights) to the Supervisor.


4. Data Visualization Agent: Focuses on creating visualizations.

Responsibilities: Receives data (from Querying or Analysis via the Supervisor) and visualization instructions from the Supervisor. Executes the Data Visualization component logic (Section IV.C), generating visualization code (potentially using the Execution API) or running pre-built plotting functions. Returns the visualization artifact (image, plot object, JSON spec) to the Supervisor.





C. Communication & State: Communication flows primarily through the Supervisor.14 Specialized agents generally do not communicate directly with each other. The Supervisor maintains the central state (e.g., original query, intermediate data, analysis results, visualization specs) and passes relevant parts of the state to specialized agents when delegating tasks. Agent frameworks like LangGraph provide robust mechanisms for managing such state transitions within a graph structure, making them well-suited for implementing this pattern.15 Clear data schemas (using Pydantic models) should define the structure of information exchanged between the Supervisor and the specialized agents.


D. Workflow Definition: While the agent system is dynamic, the high-level flow (Query → Analyze → Visualize) can often be guided by configuration or initial instructions provided to the Supervisor. The system allows for flexibility; for example, the Supervisor might decide to loop back to the Querying agent if analysis reveals insufficient data, or skip Visualization if the user only asked for analysis.


E. Agent Granularity Consideration: The term "agent" in this hierarchical structure refers to a functional role. The implementation of a specialized agent, like the Data Querying Agent, might itself be quite complex. It doesn't necessarily correspond to a single LLM call. Instead, it could encapsulate an entire multi-step workflow or even a LangGraph subgraph that performs the detailed steps of rewriting, retrieval, generation, execution, and refinement. The Supervisor interacts with this functional unit through the standardized tool interface provided by the adapter layer. This allows for modularity at the top level (Supervisor managing Query/Analyze/Viz roles) while accommodating significant complexity within each role's implementation. This approach leverages the strengths of multi-agent systems for task decomposition 14 while allowing robust implementation of complex sub-tasks. Visualization tools for agent interactions can be valuable for debugging and understanding these complex flows.46

VII. Configuration System DesignA flexible and robust configuration system is essential for managing the various aspects of the dataqa library.

A. Technology Choice: Pydantic's BaseSettings class is the recommended technology.9 Pydantic provides a powerful framework for defining configuration schemas using standard Python type hints. This enables static analysis, editor autocompletion, and, crucially, runtime validation of configuration values.11 It ensures that configurations conform to the expected structure and data types, catching errors early in the application lifecycle.12 Pydantic's widespread adoption, particularly in frameworks like FastAPI 11, makes it a familiar choice for many Python developers. It offers superior validation capabilities compared to plain dictionaries or standard dataclasses.51


B. Structure: A hierarchical structure using nested Pydantic models is appropriate for organizing the configuration logically.


A top-level DataQAConfig model will serve as the main entry point.


Nested models will encapsulate settings for specific areas:

LLMSettings: Provider (e.g., 'openai', 'anthropic', 'bedrock'), model name, API keys (using SecretStr), temperature, etc.
ExecutionAPISettings: Type ('async_rest', 'sync_rest', 'direct_python'), relevant URLs (submit, status template), authentication tokens (using SecretStr).
RAGSourceSettings: Configuration for context retrieval, potentially a list allowing multiple sources. Each source might specify its type ('vector_db', 'file_system', 'graph_db'), connection details, and pointers to schema, examples, and business rule data.
ComponentsConfig: Nested models for each core component (QueryingComponentSettings, AnalysisComponentSettings, VisualizationComponentSettings) containing component-specific parameters (e.g., rewriter toggle, prompt template paths, default analysis functions).
WorkflowDefinitions: Structures defining predefined workflows (sequences or graphs of component executions).
AgentDefinitions: Configuration for agent-based systems, including supervisor settings and specialized agent configurations.



Conceptual Example:
Pythonfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, SecretStr
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

class LLMSettings(BaseModel):
    provider: str = 'openai'
    model: str = 'gpt-4-turbo'
    api_key: Optional = None
    temperature: float = 0.1

class ExecutionAPISettings(BaseModel):
    type: str = Field('async_rest', description="Type of execution API interface")
    submit_url: Optional[str] = None
    status_url_template: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="URL template for status, e.g., /api/status/{job_id}")
    auth_token: Optional = None

class RAGSourceSettings(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: str # e.g., 'vector_db_chroma', 'local_files'
    connection_details: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    schema_source: str # Path or identifier
    examples_source: str # Path or identifier
    rules_source: str # Path or identifier

class QueryingComponentSettings(BaseModel):
    rewriter_enabled: bool = True
    retriever_type: str = 'vector_similarity'
    prompt_template_path: str = "prompts/default_query_prompt.txt"
    max_refinement_attempts: int = 3

#... Define AnalysisComponentSettings, VisualizationComponentSettings

#... Define WorkflowDefinition, AgentDefinition models

class DataQAConfig(BaseSettings):
    llm: LLMSettings = LLMSettings()
    execution_api: ExecutionAPISettings
    rag_sources: List =
    querying_component: QueryingComponentSettings = QueryingComponentSettings()
    # analysis_component: AnalysisComponentSettings =...
    # visualization_component: VisualizationComponentSettings =...
    # workflows: Dict[str, WorkflowDefinition] = {}
    # agents: Dict[str, AgentDefinition] = {}

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_prefix='DATAQA_', # Environment variables start with DATAQA_
        env_file='.env',     # Load from.env file
        env_nested_delimiter='__', # Allow DATAQA_LLM__MODEL env var
        secrets_dir=None, # Optional directory for secret files
        validate_assignment=True # Validate fields on assignment
    )





C. Loading Mechanisms: Pydantic BaseSettings inherently supports a prioritized loading order:

Arguments passed during model initialization.
Environment variables (respecting env_prefix and env_nested_delimiter).9
Variables loaded from a .env file specified by env_file.9
Variables loaded from secret files in secrets_dir.10
Default values defined in the Pydantic model fields.
This provides flexibility for development (using .env or defaults) and deployment (using environment variables or secrets). While tools like Hydra offer more advanced composition and command-line overrides 12, Pydantic's built-in capabilities are often sufficient and simpler to manage for library configuration.



D. Validation: Pydantic automatically performs type validation upon loading the configuration.9 Custom validators can be added to enforce more complex rules or cross-field dependencies if required. This ensures configuration integrity before the library components attempt to use the settings.11


E. Secrets Management: Sensitive information like API keys or authentication tokens should be handled using Pydantic's SecretStr type.10 This type prevents accidental exposure in logs or tracebacks. Values for SecretStr fields should be loaded securely from environment variables or dedicated secret files (e.g., Docker secrets mounted into a directory specified by secrets_dir) 10, never hardcoded in configuration files.1


F. Configuration Complexity Consideration: While comprehensive configuration is powerful, overly complex schemas with deep nesting or excessive options can become difficult for users to understand and manage.51 This can lead to "YAML/config engineering" 12 where determining the effective configuration requires tracing multiple overrides and defaults. The design should prioritize clarity by providing sensible defaults for most options, using logical nesting without excessive depth, and offering clear documentation for all settings and their loading precedence. Pydantic's validation errors should also be informative to help users correct misconfigurations quickly. The goal is a balance between flexibility and usability.

VIII. Development Standards & Project StructureAdhering to standard Python development practices and maintaining a well-organized project structure are crucial for collaboration, maintainability, and usability.

Dependency Management: Poetry will be used for dependency management and packaging.4 All project metadata, dependencies (core and development), and tool configurations will reside in the pyproject.toml file.54 Core library dependencies will be listed under [tool.poetry.dependencies], while development tools (like pytest, sphinx, ruff) will be in a dedicated group, e.g., [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies].54 The poetry.lock file, which ensures deterministic builds by locking dependency versions, will be committed to version control.52


B. Code Formatting & Linting: Ruff is mandated for both code formatting and linting, providing a fast and unified toolchain.54 Ruff's configuration will be managed within pyproject.toml under [tool.ruff], [tool.ruff.lint], and [tool.ruff.format] sections.54 Standard rulesets like bugbear, isort (for import sorting), and pyupgrade should be enabled.59 To enforce code style consistency, pre-commit hooks will be configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml to automatically run Ruff before commits.58


C. Testing: Pytest is the chosen framework for writing and running unit, integration, and functional tests.4 Tests will be located in the tests/ directory at the project root.59 Pytest fixtures should be used for managing test setup and teardown efficiently. Given the reliance on external services (LLMs, Execution API) and internal components interacting via Dependency Injection, mocking will be essential. Libraries like unittest.mock or pytest-mock should be used extensively to isolate components during testing, allowing verification of interactions without making actual external calls.2 High test coverage should be a target metric.


D. Documentation: Sphinx will be used for generating project documentation.52 Documentation source files (using reStructuredText or Markdown via MyST) will reside in the docs/ directory.59 Sphinx should be configured to automatically generate API reference documentation from docstrings within the source code. A consistent docstring style (e.g., Google or NumPy, supported by the Sphinx napoleon extension) should be adopted.52 The documentation must include:

Installation instructions.
A Quick Start guide.
Tutorials demonstrating common use cases (building workflows, configuring agents).
A comprehensive configuration reference detailing all options in the Pydantic models.
Detailed specification of the External Code Execution API contract.
API reference for library classes and functions.
Guidelines for developers wishing to contribute.
Documentation should be hosted publicly, for example, on ReadTheDocs 59, with build configurations managed either in pyproject.toml or a .readthedocs.yaml file.59



E. Project Layout: A standard Python project structure employing the src/ layout is recommended for clarity and to avoid potential import issues.56

F. README File: The README.md file serves as the primary entry point for users and developers.55 It must contain:

User Section: Project description, key features, installation instructions (poetry add dataqa), a concise quick start example demonstrating both workflow and agent usage, and prominent links to the full documentation.
Developer Section: Instructions for setting up the development environment (poetry install --with dev), running tests (pytest), building documentation (sphinx-build), contribution guidelines, and a brief architectural overview.



G. Versioning: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) will be strictly followed to communicate the nature of changes between releases.45 Version management can be automated using tools like setuptools-scm 54 or poetry-dynamic-versioning (if compatible with the chosen build backend) to derive the version from Git tags, or managed manually through Poetry and updated as part of the release process.


H. Continuous Integration (CI): A CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions 59) should be established to automate quality checks. The CI workflow must:

Run Ruff for linting and format checking.
Execute the Pytest suite, preferably across multiple supported Python versions using a matrix strategy or a tool like tox.
Build the Sphinx documentation to catch errors.
Optionally, automate the process of building the package and publishing it to PyPI or a private repository upon creation of release tags.60


IX. Conclusions & RecommendationsThe dataqa library presents a powerful approach to bridging the gap between natural language and structured data operations. Its success hinges on a modular, configurable, and extensible architecture.Conclusions:
Modularity is Key: Dependency Injection and a clear component interface (DataQAComponent) are fundamental to achieving the required modularity and enabling reuse across workflow and agent paradigms.
Abstraction Enables Flexibility: An adapter layer is essential for supporting multiple agent frameworks without tightly coupling core logic, though it requires careful design to balance generality and framework-specific power.
RAG is Crucial for Querying: The Data Querying component's accuracy heavily relies on effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide necessary context (schema, examples, rules) to the code-generating LLM. The quality of retrieval directly impacts the quality of generated code.
Decoupled Execution is Necessary: The External Code Execution API provides vital decoupling but necessitates an asynchronous communication pattern (like Async REST with polling) to handle potentially long-running tasks and the critical error-feedback loop for code refinement.
Hierarchical Agents Fit the Task: A supervised multi-agent architecture provides a suitable structure for orchestrating the query, analysis, and visualization steps, leveraging specialized agents for each function.
Configuration Management Needs Structure: Pydantic BaseSettings offers the best combination of type safety, validation, and flexible loading mechanisms for managing the library's configuration.
Standard Practices Ensure Quality: Adherence to established Python development standards (Poetry, Ruff, Pytest, Sphinx, CI) is non-negotiable for building a maintainable and reliable library.
Recommendations & Next Steps:
Prioritize Core Functionality: Initial development efforts should concentrate on the Data Querying component and the External Code Execution API interface and client-side logic. These are the most complex and foundational pieces. Implement the LangGraph adapter first to provide immediate agent framework support.
Phased Feature Rollout: Begin by implementing support for predefined Workflows, as they offer a more controlled environment. Subsequently, add support for dynamic Agent systems using the Supervisor pattern. Within components, focus on the core code generation capabilities before adding extensive libraries of pre-built analysis or visualization functions. Similarly, start with basic RAG (e.g., vector similarity on schema/examples) before exploring more advanced techniques like hybrid search or graph RAG.
Finalize API Contract: Solidify the asynchronous External Code Execution API specification early in the development process. Provide clear documentation and potentially a simple reference server implementation to guide users who need to build the corresponding backend for their environment. Seriously consider offering the alternative Python adapter interface (Insight 5) for users who prefer direct integration over a network API.
Invest Heavily in Testing: Rigorous testing is paramount, especially integration tests covering the end-to-end flow of the Data Querying component: NLQ -> RAG -> Prompting -> LLM -> Code -> Execution API -> Error Handling -> Refinement -> Execution API -> Result. Mocking the LLM and Execution API effectively will be critical.
Continuous Documentation: Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation throughout the development lifecycle. Pay special attention to documenting the configuration options and the External Code Execution API contract, as these are key user-facing aspects.
By following this specification and prioritizing these recommendations, the dataqa library can be developed into a robust, flexible, and powerful tool for natural language interaction with data.
