Act as an amazing software architect. Below is my idea which i fed to multple LLMs and collected their responses. Can you take a look at all the responses and give me an unified solution for my idea.

MY IDEA
=========================
I am trying to solve the problem of natural language querying against databases. This usually involves 3 steps at a high level
* Data Querying
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
Data Querying: Databases sometimes can be queried using SQL (Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, etc..). Sometimes we don't have the access to the direct database and instead we will do an API call or a function call to retrive the data.
Data Analytics: We either generate the code for analytics or we could use the set of pre-built functions we have.
Data Visualization: We either generate the code for visualization or we could use the set of pre-built functions we have


dataqa - A config driven python library for natural language querying of databases
The users should have the ability to build Agents or Workflows (Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks) depending on their needs. Everything should be config driven.

We want to build this library in a way that its easy to switch/add support to new libraries in the future. Currently we want to support Langgraph to begin with; (meaning the workflows and agents we create will be langgraph based). Its important to keep in mind that if we want to add CrewAI or Autogen or Pydantic AI, we should be able to add it without changing a lot of the existing code. So, do not fully couple the library with langgraph.

We also don't want to be in the business to provide multiple connectors to different databases, instead we will ask the user to provide a code execution api (data api) to take the code generated by the dataqa library and execute it their apis and send the results back. I am not exactly sure how do we handle the back and forth here; meaning if we get error, how do we go back and regenerate the code. Is MCP servers a better idea here than a traditional API? I really don't know. Need ideas here

In order to provide the option of both Agents and Workflows, we need to build a bunch of components which we should be able to use to build a workflow graph as well as use the component as a tool for any Agent. There should be a base component and the rest of the components should derive from it. We can have some hierarchy here. for example. code_executor/base can be derived from the base component and in_memory code executor and api based code executor can be derived from code_executor/base. We should also have a generic LLM generation component which we can use to build any LLM related components. These are just some ideas.

When it comes to Agent, I am thinking it will be multi agent system where there will be a high level agent which can call other agents like data querying agent, data analysis agent, data visualization agent. These agents can inturn use the components built abvove as tools.


Data Querying is the most important step in this. This usually requires the assets below
    * business rules
    * examples (query-code pairs with an optional reasoning)
    * schema of the databases (table name, table description, column name, column description, column type, column values)
The users will provide these assets via yaml/txt files and we should be able to ingest them in a knowledge base  like opensearch (for example or a simple local store for testing) and use them to retrieve.
For retrieval we will do multiple ways: dense retrival (embedding vector based), sparse retrieval (bm35), hybrid (combination of sparse and dense), tag based where the users can have tags assigned to each business rule, example and schema. we can then do tag based retrival along with other types too.

Usually for data querying,
    * we rewrite the user question,
    * retrieve the schema, examples, business rules that is relevant to the current context
    * compose the final prompt with the retrieved assets which we send to LLM for code generation steps
    * we then send the code generated to the code execution api to get the result bad


Guidelines:
* For python environment management use poetry
* Sphinx style documentation
* Readme with a section to use the library and a section for developers
* Use pytest for testing
* Use ruff for formatting and linting
* Use YAML based config
* The system support real-time interaction or only batch processes (e.g., for agents and workflows)?
* To handle iterative code regeneration on execution failure — depending on the type of error we may want to retry logic with error analysis, or add human-in-the-loop mechanisms
* For LangGraph, lets use Graph API style when building workflows or Agents
* Lets start with AzureOpenAI for LLM


Can you create me a detailed breakdown of steps which i can feed to an LLM so i can make it generate the entire library. As many details as possible. The entire library should be config driven.


==================================
LLM Response - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Version2
==================================
Okay, let's break down the requirements for the `dataqa` library into a detailed, step-by-step plan suitable for guiding an LLM code generation process.

**Project Goal:** Create `dataqa`, a config-driven Python library for natural language querying of databases, supporting data querying, analysis, and visualization. It should allow users to build both predefined Workflows and dynamic Agents, initially using LangGraph but designed for easy integration with other frameworks (CrewAI, Autogen, etc.). It relies on a user-provided external API for code execution.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Config-Driven:** All aspects (components, workflows, agents, connections, assets) should be configurable via YAML.
2.  **Modularity & Extensibility:** Design with interfaces and abstractions to easily swap or add components, LLM providers, knowledge bases, retrieval methods, and orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.). Avoid tight coupling.
3.  **Component-Based:** Build reusable components for specific tasks (e.g., query rewriting, code generation, data retrieval, execution) that can be used standalone, within Workflows, or as Tools for Agents.
4.  **External Execution:** Do not include database connectors. Define a clear interface for interacting with a user-provided code execution API.
5.  **Robust Data Querying:** Implement a sophisticated data querying pipeline involving question rewriting, context retrieval (schema, examples, rules) from a knowledge base, prompt composition, code generation, and execution/error handling.
6.  **Workflow & Agent Support:** Provide mechanisms to define and run both static LangGraph Workflows and dynamic LangGraph Agents using the defined components.
7.  **Standard Development Practices:** Use Poetry, Pytest, Ruff, Sphinx, and provide clear documentation.

**Detailed Breakdown for LLM Code Generation:**

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Abstractions**

1.  **Initialize Project using Poetry:**
    * Run `poetry init dataqa`
    * Define basic metadata, Python version (e.g., 3.9+), and core dependencies (`pyyaml`, `pydantic`, `langchain-core`, `langgraph`, `langchain-openai` for Azure).
    * Add development dependencies: `pytest`, `ruff`, `sphinx`.
2.  **Establish Directory Structure:**

3.  **Define Core Interfaces (`core/base_classes.py`):**
    * `BaseComponent(ABC)`: Abstract base class for all components. Must have `run(self, context: Dict) -> Dict` method. Should handle loading its specific config section.
    * `BaseLLMService(ABC)`: Interface for interacting with LLMs (e.g., `generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str`).
    * `BaseKnowledgeBase(ABC)`: Interface for storing and retrieving assets (e.g., `add_asset(self, asset_type: str, content: Dict, tags: List[str] = None)`, `retrieve_assets(self, query: str, asset_types: List[str], k: int, retrieval_mode: str, tags: List[str] = None) -> List[Dict]`).
    * `BaseRetriever(ABC)`: Interface for retrieval logic (e.g., `retrieve(self, query: str, knowledge_base: BaseKnowledgeBase, k: int, mode: str, tags: List[str] = None) -> List[Dict]`).
    * `BaseWorkflowEngine(ABC)`: Interface to build and run workflows (e.g., `build(self, config: Dict) -> Any`, `run(self, workflow: Any, input_data: Dict) -> Dict`).
    * `BaseAgentFramework(ABC)`: Interface to build and run agents (e.g., `build(self, config: Dict) -> Any`, `run(self, agent: Any, input_data: Dict) -> Dict`).
4.  **Define Configuration Models (`core/config_models.py`):**
    * Use Pydantic models to define the structure of the main YAML config file and its sections (e.g., `GlobalConfig`, `LLMServiceConfig`, `KnowledgeBaseConfig`, `ComponentConfig`, `WorkflowConfig`, `AgentConfig`). This enables validation.

**Phase 2: Configuration and Foundational Services**

5.  **Implement Configuration Loading (`utils/config_loader.py`):**
    * Create a function `load_config(path: str) -> Dict` that reads a YAML file.
    * Integrate Pydantic validation using the models from `core/config_models.py`.
6.  **Implement LLM Service (`llm_services/`):**
    * Create `AzureOpenAIService(BaseLLMService)`: Implement the `generate` method using `langchain-openai`'s AzureChatOpenAI. Load credentials and endpoint details from config.
7.  **Implement Knowledge Base (`knowledge_bases/`):**
    * Create `LocalKnowledgeBase(BaseKnowledgeBase)`: Store assets in memory (e.g., dictionary) or simple JSON files. Implement `add_asset` and `retrieve_assets` (basic filtering/search). Suitable for testing.
    * *(Optional/Advanced)* Define `OpenSearchKnowledgeBase(BaseKnowledgeBase)`: Interface with an OpenSearch cluster. Requires `opensearch-py`. Implement methods using OpenSearch queries (keyword, vector, hybrid).

**Phase 3: Component Implementation**

8.  **Implement Base Components (`components/*/base.py`):**
    * Define base classes for component categories that inherit from `BaseComponent` if they share common logic (e.g., `BaseLLMGenerationComponent` might take an `BaseLLMService` instance).
9.  **Implement LLM Generation Component (`components/llm/`):**
    * `AzureOpenAIGenerationComponent(BaseLLMGenerationComponent)`: Takes configuration (prompt template, LLM service alias, generation parameters). Uses the configured `BaseLLMService` instance to generate text based on input context and the template.
10. **Implement Code Executor Component (`components/execution/`):**
    * `ApiCodeExecutorComponent(BaseCodeExecutorComponent)`:
        * Takes configuration: API endpoint URL, request method (e.g., POST), headers/auth details, expected request/response format (define this clearly, e.g., `{ "code": "...", "context": "..." }` -> `{ "result": "...", "error": "..." }` or `{ "data": [...], "log": "..." }`).
        * Implements `run`: Sends the code (and potentially context) from its input dictionary to the API, receives the response.
        * Parses the response, extracting results or error messages. Returns these in its output dictionary.
        * Handles connection errors, timeouts.
11. **Implement Knowledge/Retrieval Components (`components/knowledge/`, `components/retrieval/`):**
    * `AssetIngestorComponent`: Takes file paths/config for assets (schema, rules, examples). Parses them (YAML/TXT). Uses the configured `BaseKnowledgeBase` to store them.
    * `RetrieverComponent(BaseRetrieverComponent)`:
        * Takes configuration: knowledge base alias, default `k`, retrieval modes to use (dense, sparse, hybrid, tags).
        * Uses the configured `BaseRetriever` implementation.
        * Implements `run`: Takes a query from input context, calls the retriever, returns retrieved assets.
    * Implement specific `BaseRetriever` strategies (`DenseRetriever`, `SparseRetriever`, etc.). These will likely need embedding models (configurable, e.g., from `langchain-huggingface`) and potentially libraries like `rank_bm25`. The actual retrieval logic happens here, often interacting with the `BaseKnowledgeBase`.
12. **Implement Data Querying Components (`components/querying/`):**
    * `QueryRewriterComponent`: Uses an `LLMGenerationComponent`. Takes user query, chat history (optional). Generates a clearer, standalone query suitable for retrieval/code generation.
    * `PromptComposerComponent`: Takes rewritten query, retrieved context (schema, examples, rules), and a base prompt template (configurable). Constructs the final detailed prompt for the code generation LLM.
    * `CodeGeneratorComponent`: Uses an `LLMGenerationComponent`. Takes the composed prompt. Generates code (e.g., SQL, Python).
13. **Implement Analysis/Visualization Components (`components/analysis/`, `components/visualization/`):**
    * `DataAnalysisComponent`: Can use an `LLMGenerationComponent` ("Summarize this data", "Find outliers") or wrap pre-built Python functions (e.g., pandas operations). Takes data and analysis instruction.
    * `DataVisualizationComponent`: Can use an `LLMGenerationComponent` ("Create a bar chart of X vs Y") to generate plotting code (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly) or wrap pre-built plotting functions. Takes data and visualization instruction.

**Phase 4: Orchestration (LangGraph)**

14. **Implement LangGraph Engine (`orchestration/langgraph/engine.py`):**
    * `LangGraphWorkflowEngine(BaseWorkflowEngine)`:
        * `build`: Takes a workflow config (defining nodes, edges, state). Maps node names to initialized `dataqa` components. Uses LangGraph's `graph.add_node`, `graph.add_edge`, `graph.set_entry_point`, `graph.set_finish_point`, `graph.add_conditional_edges`. Compiles the graph using `graph.compile()`. Use the Graph API style (`langgraph.graph.Graph()` or `langgraph.graph.MessageGraph()`).
        * `run`: Executes `compiled_graph.invoke(input_data)`.
15. **Define a Sample Query Workflow Configuration:**
    * Create `examples/query_workflow.yaml`:
        * Define nodes: `rewrite_query`, `retrieve_context`, `compose_prompt`, `generate_code`, `execute_code`, `handle_error`.
        * Map nodes to `dataqa` components and their configs.
        * Define state schema (e.g., `user_query`, `rewritten_query`, `retrieved_context`, `prompt`, `generated_code`, `execution_result`, `error_message`, `retry_count`).
        * Define edges: `rewrite_query` -> `retrieve_context` -> `compose_prompt` -> `generate_code` -> `execute_code`.
        * Conditional Edge from `execute_code`: If error -> `handle_error`. If success -> END.
        * `handle_error` node: Analyzes the error. If retries left & recoverable error -> `generate_code` (passing error info for correction). Else -> END (with error state).
16. **Implement LangGraph Agent Framework (`orchestration/langgraph/agent.py`):**
    * `LangGraphAgentFramework(BaseAgentFramework)`:
        * `build`: Takes an agent config (defining agent type - e.g., ReAct, tools, LLM). Maps tool names to initialized `dataqa` components (wrapping their `run` method). Instantiates a LangGraph agent executor (e.g., `create_react_agent`).
        * `run`: Executes `agent_executor.invoke(input_data)`.
17. **Define Sample Agent Configurations:**
    * Create `examples/query_agent.yaml`: Defines a basic agent whose tools are `dataqa` components like `QueryRewriterComponent`, `RetrieverComponent`, `CodeGeneratorComponent`, `ApiCodeExecutorComponent`.
    * *(Optional/Advanced)* Create `examples/multi_agent_system.yaml`: Defines a supervisor agent and sub-agents (e.g., `DataQueryAgent`, `DataAnalysisAgent`) using LangGraph's multi-agent collaboration features. The sub-agents would use the relevant `dataqa` components as tools.

**Phase 5: Execution Handling and Iteration**

18. **Refine `ApiCodeExecutorComponent` Error Handling:**
    * Ensure it robustly parses various error types from the user's API response (syntax errors, execution errors, timeouts, data errors). Standardize error representation in the output dictionary.
19. **Implement Error Handling Logic (within LangGraph Workflow/Agent):**
    * In the Workflow (`handle_error` node): Add logic to inspect the error from `execute_code`. Increment retry count in state. Based on error type and retry count, decide whether to loop back to `generate_code` (potentially adding error details to the context for the LLM) or terminate.
    * In the Agent: The agent's LLM decides the next step based on the tool's error output. Ensure the `ApiCodeExecutorComponent` tool provides informative error descriptions. The LLM might decide to re-run the `CodeGeneratorComponent` with modified instructions or try a different approach.
20. **Address MCP vs API:**
    * For the initial version, stick to the stateless API approach for the `ApiCodeExecutorComponent`. It's simpler to implement on both sides.
    * Document the required API interface clearly: endpoint, method, expected JSON request (containing code, maybe context), expected JSON response (containing results OR structured error information).
    * State that MCP/WebSockets could be future enhancements if real-time, stateful interaction with the execution environment proves necessary, but increases complexity significantly.

**Phase 6: Development Standards, Testing, and Documentation**

21. **Implement Linting and Formatting:**
    * Configure `ruff` in `pyproject.toml`. Run `ruff check .` and `ruff format .` regularly.
22. **Write Unit Tests (`tests/`):**
    * Create unit tests for all core classes and components. Mock dependencies (LLM services, KBs, API calls). Test configuration loading and Pydantic validation.
    * Test `ApiCodeExecutorComponent`'s parsing of various success and error responses.
    * Test different retrieval strategies.
23. **Write Integration Tests (`tests/`):**
    * Test the integration of components within a sample LangGraph workflow (using mocked execution).
    * Test a simple LangGraph agent using component-based tools (mocked execution).
24. **Write Documentation (`docs/`):**
    * Configure `sphinx`. Use Napoleon extension for Google/NumPy style docstrings.
    * Write clear docstrings for all public classes and methods (Sphinx style).
    * Create documentation pages:
        * `index.rst` (Introduction)
        * `installation.rst`
        * `quickstart.rst` (Using a pre-built workflow/agent example)
        * `configuration.rst` (Detailed explanation of YAML structure)
        * `components.rst` (Reference for all built-in components)
        * `knowledge_base.rst` (How to set up assets and KBs)
        * `retrieval.rst` (Explaining retrieval methods)
        * `workflows.rst` (How to build custom LangGraph workflows)
        * `agents.rst` (How to build custom LangGraph agents)
        * `code_execution_api.rst` (Specification for the user's API)
        * `developer_guide.rst` (How to contribute, add new components/frameworks)
        * `api.rst` (Auto-generated API reference using `sphinx.ext.autodoc`)
25. **Create README (`README.md`):**
    * Include: Project description, Installation (`poetry install`), Quick Start (simple example code using a config file), Configuration Overview, Link to full documentation, Developer Guide (running tests, linting, contributing).

**Phase 7: Refinement and Examples**

26. **Build Comprehensive Examples (`examples/`):**
    * Provide complete, runnable examples with sample YAML configs and Python scripts for:
        * Running a data querying workflow.
        * Running a data querying agent.
        * A workflow that includes analysis and visualization steps.
        * Sample asset files (schema.yaml, rules.txt, examples.yaml).
27. **Consider Real-time vs. Batch:**
    * The library itself is synchronous. Whether interaction feels "real-time" depends on how quickly the LLM responds and the user's code execution API returns results. For long-running queries/executions, the process will be batch-like. LangGraph's streaming support could be leveraged for partial results if needed later. Design components to return results when complete.

This detailed breakdown provides a structured plan, emphasizing modularity and configuration, which an LLM can use to generate the initial code structure and implementation details for the `dataqa` library. Remember that iterative refinement and testing will be crucial.

LLM Response - Gemini 2.5 Deep Research - Version2
===============================
Design and Implementation Strategy for the dataqa Natural Language Querying Library1. IntroductionThis document outlines the architectural design and implementation plan for dataqa, a configurable Python library enabling natural language querying against databases and APIs. The library aims to provide a flexible framework encompassing data querying, analysis, and visualization, supporting both predefined workflows and dynamic agentic systems. Key design goals include modularity, configurability via YAML, extensibility to support various orchestration frameworks (starting with LangGraph), and robust error handling for iterative code generation.2. Core Project Structure and ConfigurationA well-defined project structure and configuration system are foundational for maintainability and usability. The dataqa library will adhere to modern Python development standards.2.1. Project Setup and Dependency Management (Poetry)The project will utilize Poetry for dependency management and packaging. This ensures reproducible builds and simplifies environment setup for both users and developers. The pyproject.toml file will define project metadata, dependencies (core, development, documentation), and tool configurations (Ruff, Pytest).
Core Dependencies: langchain, langgraph, pyyaml, openai (for Azure OpenAI initially), potentially libraries for vector stores (faiss-cpu, chromadb) or sparse retrieval (rank_bm25).
Development Dependencies: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, pre-commit.
Documentation Dependencies: sphinx, sphinx-rtd-theme, myst-parser.
2.2. Code Formatting and Linting (Ruff)Ruff will be employed for code formatting and linting, configured within pyproject.toml. It consolidates multiple tools (like Flake8, isort, pyupgrade) into a single, fast executable. Pre-commit hooks will be configured to automatically run Ruff on staged files, ensuring consistent code style and quality across the codebase before commits are made. This practice significantly improves readability and reduces trivial errors.2.3. Testing Framework (Pytest)Pytest will be the standard framework for all automated tests. Its fixture system allows for clean setup and teardown of test resources (like mock components or temporary configurations). Tests will be organized into unit and integration directories within a top-level tests folder. Coverage reporting will be configured to track test completeness.2.4. Documentation Generation (Sphinx)Sphinx will be used to generate comprehensive documentation from docstrings (following Sphinx style) and narrative .rst or .md files (using myst-parser). This includes API reference documentation automatically extracted from the code, alongside tutorials and architectural explanations. The documentation will be hosted separately (e.g., Read the Docs) or included within the repository.2.5. Centralized YAML Configuration (config.yaml)The entire behavior of the dataqa library will be driven by a central YAML configuration file (e.g., config.yaml). This promotes flexibility and allows users to customize workflows, agents, components, and integrations without modifying Python code. The top-level structure will include:YAML# config.yaml (Example Structure)

This structure allows defining multiple LLM providers, knowledge base configurations, reusable component instances, and then composing them into specific workflows or agent configurations. References (_ref suffix) link different parts of the configuration together.3. Modular Component System DesignA core principle of dataqa is modularity, achieved through a component-based architecture. Components encapsulate specific functionalities (e.g., LLM interaction, retrieval, code execution) and can be combined to build complex workflows or used as tools by agents.3.1. Base Component (BaseComponent)All components will inherit from an abstract base class, BaseComponent. This class will define a common interface and potentially handle shared logic like configuration loading and validation (e.g., using Pydantic models). A key method will be execute (or similar), defining the primary action of the component.Pythonfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Dict

class BaseComponent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = self._validate_config(config)
        # Potentially load resources based on config

    @abstractmethod
    def _validate_config(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Validate config using Pydantic or similar
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        # Core logic of the component
        pass
3.2. Component Hierarchy and Key ComponentsComponents will be organized logically, potentially using sub-packages (e.g., dataqa.retrieval, dataqa.execution). Inheritance can be used for specialization.

(a) Generic LLM Interaction Component (LLMComponent):

Purpose: Abstract interaction with different LLM providers.
Interface: generate(prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str
Configuration: Provider type (initially azure_openai), model name, API keys/endpoints, generation parameters (temperature, max tokens).
Implementation: Will use provider-specific libraries (e.g., openai SDK for Azure). Designed to easily add support for other providers (Anthropic, Gemini) by adding new implementation classes selected via configuration.



(b) Knowledge Base Ingestion Component (KBIngestionComponent):

Purpose: Parse and load schema, business rules, and examples from user-provided files into the configured knowledge base store.
Interface: ingest(asset_definitions: List[Dict]) -> None (where asset_definitions come from config.yaml).
Configuration: Knowledge base store details (type, connection/path).
Implementation: Handles parsing of YAML and TXT files based on type specified in config. Interacts with the chosen storage backend (local or OpenSearch) to index the content (text, embeddings, tags).



(c) Context Retrieval Component (BaseRetrievalComponent, DenseRetriever, SparseRetriever, HybridRetriever, TagRetriever):

Purpose: Retrieve relevant context (schema, rules, examples) from the knowledge base based on the current query/context.
Hierarchy: BaseRetrievalComponent (abstract) -> specific implementations. HybridRetriever might internally use instances of DenseRetriever and SparseRetriever.
Interface: retrieve(query: str, tags: List[str] = None, top_k: int = 5) -> List[Document] (where Document is a structured object containing content, metadata, score).
Configuration: Knowledge base reference, retrieval strategy parameters (e.g., dense_weight, sparse_weight for hybrid), top_k.
Implementation: Implements logic for vector similarity search (dense), BM25 (sparse), result fusion (hybrid), and filtering/boosting based on tags.



(d) Code Generation Component (CodeGenerationComponent):

Purpose: Generate code (e.g., SQL, Python) based on a user query and retrieved context using an LLM.
Interface: generate_code(query: str, context: List[Document]) -> str
Configuration: LLM component reference, prompt template path/reference.
Implementation: Uses a PromptBuilder utility (see Section 4.4) to construct the final prompt from the template, query, and context. Calls the configured LLMComponent to get the code string.



(e) Code Execution Interface Component (BaseCodeExecutor, ApiCodeExecutor, InMemoryCodeExecutor):

Purpose: Define the interface and implement methods for executing generated code.
Hierarchy: BaseCodeExecutor (abstract) defining the interface -> ApiCodeExecutor (interacts with user's external API), InMemoryCodeExecutor (optional, executes Python code directly, e.g., for Pandas analysis).
Interface: execute(code: str, language: str) -> ExecutionResult (where ExecutionResult is a structured object containing status, result data, error details - see Section 5.1).
Configuration: Specifics for each type (e.g., API endpoint URL, headers for ApiCodeExecutor; allowed modules for InMemoryCodeExecutor).



(f) Data Analysis Component (AnalysisComponent):

Purpose: Perform data analysis based on user request, using either generated code or predefined functions.
Interface: analyze(data: Any, analysis_request: str) -> AnalysisResult
Configuration: mode ('code_generation' or 'predefined_functions'), LLM reference and prompt template (if mode is code_gen), path/reference to predefined function library (if mode is predefined).
Implementation: If code_generation, uses LLM to generate analysis code (e.g., Python/Pandas) and potentially executes it using InMemoryCodeExecutor. If predefined_functions, dynamically loads and calls appropriate functions based on the analysis_request.



(g) Data Visualization Component (VisualizationComponent):

Purpose: Generate visualizations based on data and user request.
Interface: visualize(data: Any, viz_request: str) -> VisualizationResult
Configuration: Similar to AnalysisComponent (mode, LLM/prompt config, predefined function config).
Implementation: If code_generation, uses LLM to generate visualization code (e.g., Python with Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly) and potentially executes it or returns the code/spec. If predefined_functions, calls specific plotting functions.


This component design ensures separation of concerns and allows users to easily swap implementations (e.g., change retrieval strategy, LLM provider) via configuration.4. Knowledge Base Implementation DetailsThe knowledge base is critical for providing the LLM with the necessary context to generate accurate code. It stores schema definitions, business logic, and examples of correct query-code pairs.4.1. Asset Parsing and LoadingThe KBIngestionComponent will be responsible for processing assets defined in the config.yaml.
Schema: YAML files defining tables, columns, types, descriptions, and potentially sample values. Parsed into structured objects.
Business Rules: Plain text files (.txt) containing rules or constraints relevant to data querying (e.g., "Sales data before 2020 is archived", "Use user_id not employee_id for customer queries"). Each rule might be treated as a separate document.
Examples: Pairs of natural language queries and their corresponding correct code (e.g., SQL). These can be in structured YAML/JSON files or potentially parsed from formatted text files within a directory. An optional "reasoning" field explaining why the code is correct for the query can significantly aid LLM few-shot learning.
4.2. Storage OptionsThe library should support multiple storage backends for the knowledge base, configurable via knowledge_base.store_type.
Local Storage: For ease of setup and testing.

Vectors: Use libraries like FAISS or ChromaDB to store embeddings locally in files.
Text/Metadata/Tags: Simple file storage (e.g., JSON, Parquet) or in-memory dictionaries for smaller datasets.


OpenSearch: For scalability and production deployments.

Leverages OpenSearch's k-NN plugin for efficient dense vector search.
Utilizes OpenSearch's text indexing (BM25) for sparse retrieval.
Can store metadata and tags alongside text and vectors for combined filtering.
Requires configuration of the OpenSearch cluster connection details.


The ingestion component will abstract the interaction with the specific backend.4.3. Retrieval StrategiesThe RetrievalComponent needs to implement various strategies to find the most relevant context for a given query. The choice of strategy or combination can be configured.
Dense Retrieval:

Mechanism: Embed both the user query and the knowledge base documents (schema items, rules, examples) into high-dimensional vectors using a sentence transformer model (configurable). Retrieve documents whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding based on cosine similarity.
Pros: Captures semantic meaning well.
Cons: Requires embedding model, compute for indexing/querying.


Sparse Retrieval:

Mechanism: Use term-frequency based methods like BM25. Retrieve documents that share important keywords with the query.
Pros: Efficient, good at keyword matching.
Cons: May miss semantic similarity if wording differs.


Hybrid Retrieval:

Mechanism: Combine results from both dense and sparse retrieval. Typically involves running both searches, then re-ranking results using a fusion algorithm (e.g., Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) or simple weighted score combination). Configurable weights (dense_weight, sparse_weight) allow tuning the balance.
Pros: Often yields better results than either method alone by leveraging both semantic and keyword relevance.


Tag-Based Retrieval/Filtering:

Mechanism: Filter or boost documents based on tags assigned during ingestion (defined in config.yaml). Users can specify required tags alongside their query (e.g., "Show sales data" + tags: [sales, current_quarter]). The retrieval component performs set operations (intersection/union) or uses tag information during ranking.
Pros: Allows explicit scoping of retrieval to relevant domains, improving precision.


The RetrievalComponent should return a ranked list of Document objects, each containing the content and metadata (source, tags, score).5. End-to-End Data Querying Process FlowThe core function of dataqa is translating a natural language query into executable code and retrieving data. This involves a sequence of steps orchestrated by a workflow or agent.5.1. User Query InputThe process begins with the user providing a natural language query (e.g., "What were the total sales for product X last quarter?").5.2. Query Rewriting/Clarification (Optional)An optional initial step can involve refining the user query. This might include:
Expanding abbreviations or resolving ambiguity.
Asking clarifying questions if the query is underspecified (potentially involving Human-in-the-Loop, see Section 5.4).
Using an LLM to rephrase the query for better retrieval performance.
This step would likely involve a dedicated component or logic within the workflow/agent.
5.3. Context RetrievalThe (potentially rewritten) query is passed to the configured RetrievalComponent. This component queries the knowledge base using the selected strategy (dense, sparse, hybrid, tag-based) to fetch the most relevant:
Schema definitions (tables, columns likely related to the query).
Business rules applicable to the query's domain.
Similar query-code examples.
5.4. Prompt CompositionA crucial step is constructing the final prompt to be sent to the LLM for code generation. This is typically handled by a dedicated utility or logic within the CodeGenerationComponent. The prompt must effectively combine:
The user's query (original or rewritten).
Clear instructions for the LLM (e.g., "Generate SQL code for the following request.", "Use the provided schema.", "Adhere to the business rules.").
The retrieved context, clearly demarcated (e.g., using sections like ### Schema, ### Business Rules, ### Examples). Presenting schema informatively (e.g., CREATE TABLE statements or similar structured formats) is vital.
Few-shot examples (retrieved query-code pairs) can significantly improve accuracy, especially for complex queries or specific syntax requirements.
Prompt Engineering Considerations: The structure and phrasing of this prompt heavily influence the quality of the generated code. The system must handle cases where the retrieved context might exceed the LLM's context window limit. Strategies include:
Prioritizing context based on retrieval scores.
Summarizing less critical information.
Using more advanced techniques like document compression.
To allow for easy experimentation and optimization, prompt templates should be externalized (e.g., loaded from files referenced in config.yaml) rather than hardcoded in Python. This flexibility is essential as optimal prompt structures can vary based on the LLM, task, and available context.
5.5. Code GenerationThe composed prompt is sent to the configured LLMComponent via the CodeGenerationComponent. The LLM processes the prompt and returns the generated code string (e.g., SQL, Python).5.6. Code ExecutionThe generated code string is passed to the configured CodeExecutionComponent (typically the ApiCodeExecutor). This component sends the code to the user-provided execution environment (via API call).5.7. Result HandlingThe CodeExecutionComponent returns an ExecutionResult object. If successful (status: 'success'), it contains the data retrieved from the database/API. If unsuccessful (status: 'error'), it contains structured error information, triggering the iterative refinement loop (Section 5).6. Code Execution Interface and Iterative RefinementA robust mechanism for executing generated code and handling failures is paramount for a reliable NLQ system. Since dataqa relies on a user-provided execution endpoint, a clear contract and intelligent error handling are necessary.6.1. Execution API Contract DefinitionTo ensure reliable communication between dataqa and the user's execution environment, a well-defined API contract is essential. A standard RESTful JSON API is recommended.
Request (from dataqa to User API):
JSON{
  "code": "SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition",
  "language": "sql", // or "python", etc.
  "session_id": "optional_session_identifier" // For stateful interactions if needed
}


Response (from User API to dataqa):
JSON{
  "status": "success", // or "error"
  "result": [ // Present if status is 'success'
    {"column": "value1"},
    {"column": "value2"}
  ],
  "error_type": null, // or e.g., "SyntaxError", "DatabaseError", "TimeoutError", "PermissionError"
  "error_message": null, // or "Detailed error message/traceback from execution environment"
  "logs": null // or ["Optional line 1", "Optional line 2"]
}


This structured response, particularly the error_type and error_message, is critical. It provides the necessary detail for dataqa to understand why execution failed, enabling more effective correction strategies than a simple pass/fail signal.6.2. Error Handling, Parsing, and AnalysisWithin dataqa (likely coordinated by the workflow/agent logic, potentially using a dedicated ErrorAnalysisComponent), the error response from the execution API needs to be parsed and analyzed.
Parsing: Extract status, error_type, and error_message.
Analysis: Map error patterns to likely causes:

SyntaxError: Often indicates an LLM hallucination or misunderstanding of SQL/Python syntax.
DatabaseError (e.g., NoSuchTableError, NoSuchColumnError): Suggests the LLM used schema elements not present in the provided context, or the context was incomplete/incorrect.
PermissionError, TimeoutError: Usually indicate issues in the execution environment or database itself, likely not fixable by code regeneration alone.


Strategy Selection: Based on the analysis, decide the next step:

Syntax/Semantic Errors: Trigger iterative regeneration (Section 6.3).
Schema Mismatches: Potentially trigger re-retrieval with a modified query targeting the problematic schema elements, followed by regeneration.
Environment Errors: Report back to the user; automated retries might be possible, but often require external intervention.


Intelligent analysis avoids futile retries. Understanding the nature of the error allows for targeted corrective actions, making the refinement process more efficient.6.3. Iterative Code Regeneration StrategiesWhen an error is deemed potentially fixable by the LLM (e.g., syntax errors), an iterative loop is triggered within the workflow/agent.
Mechanism: The workflow transitions back to the CodeGenerationComponent node.
Prompt Modification: A new prompt is constructed, incorporating feedback about the failure:

The original user query.
Relevant context (potentially updated based on error analysis).
The previously generated code that failed.
The specific error information (error_type, error_message).
Explicit instructions, e.g., "The following code failed with a SyntaxError: [Error Message]. Please fix the code. Failed code: [Previous Code]".


Context Adjustment: If the error suggests missing context (e.g., NoSuchColumnError), the system could attempt to retrieve schema details for the specific table/column mentioned in the error before regenerating.
Retry Limit: Implement a maximum number of retry attempts (configurable) to prevent infinite loops in cases where the LLM cannot resolve the error.
Providing the LLM with the failed code and the exact error message gives it the necessary information to attempt self-correction, which is generally more effective than simply asking it to "try again".6.4. Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) Integration PointsFully automated NLQ can be brittle. Incorporating optional Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) checkpoints can enhance robustness and user trust.
Potential Integration Points:

Query Clarification: If the initial query is ambiguous, pause and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
Code Review: Before executing potentially impactful code (e.g., DML statements, though focus is likely DQL), pause for user review and approval. This should be configurable.
Error Resolution: If automated error analysis and regeneration fail after several attempts, present the error and context to the user for guidance or manual correction.
Result Validation: Allow users to provide feedback on whether the final result correctly answers their query.


Implementation: Design the workflow/agent framework with hooks or specific states where execution can pause. These hooks could trigger callbacks, emit events, or update a status that an external UI or process monitors, waiting for user input before resuming. HIL should always be optional and configurable.
6.5. Comparative Analysis: Traditional API vs. MCP ServersThe user query raised the question of whether a traditional API or an alternative like Managed Component Provider (MCP) servers would be better for the code execution interface, especially given the iterative nature.

Traditional API (e.g., REST/HTTP):

State Management: Typically stateless; each request is independent. State (like session info) must be passed explicitly if needed.
Interaction Model: Request/Response. Well-understood, widely supported.
Error Feedback Richness: Dependent on the API implementation (as defined in Section 6.1). Can be made very rich.
Deployment Complexity (User): Relatively straightforward; users deploy a standard web service endpoint.
Security Considerations: Standard API security practices (authentication, authorization, input validation).
Suitability for Iteration: Works well if the API provides detailed error feedback. The stateless nature simplifies dataqa's interaction logic but requires the user API to handle setup/teardown for each execution if needed (e.g., DB connection).



MCP Server (Conceptual): (Note: MCP is not a standard protocol; interpretation based on potential stateful interaction concepts)

State Management: Potentially stateful; could maintain a connection or execution environment across multiple calls within a session.
Interaction Model: Could be RPC-based or use persistent connections (e.g., WebSockets). Might allow more complex interactions than simple request/response.
Error Feedback Richness: Could potentially provide richer state-related debugging information if the environment persists.
Deployment Complexity (User): Likely higher; requires implementing and managing a potentially stateful server component, possibly with custom protocols. Less standardized than REST.
Security Considerations: Maintaining state introduces potential complexities around resource management and session security.
Suitability for Iteration: The stateful nature might simplify debugging certain types of errors that occur over multiple steps. However, the increased complexity for the user implementing the MCP endpoint and the lack of standardization are significant drawbacks.


Recommendation: For dataqa, a well-defined traditional stateless API (REST/HTTP) with rich, structured error reporting (as defined in Section 6.1) is the recommended approach. It offers the best balance of simplicity for the user, standardization, and sufficient capability to support the iterative refinement loop. The benefits of a hypothetical stateful MCP seem marginal compared to the increased implementation burden and complexity it would impose on the users of the dataqa library.7. Agent and Workflow Integration Strategydataqa needs to support both predefined, graph-based workflows and more dynamic, LLM-driven agents. The design must accommodate LangGraph initially while allowing future integration of other frameworks.7.1. LangGraph Implementation (Graph API Style)LangGraph will be the initial framework for orchestrating component interactions.
Component Mapping: Each dataqa component instance (defined in config.yaml) will be wrapped within a LangGraph node. The node function will typically instantiate the component (if not already done) and call its execute method, passing relevant data from the graph's state.
State Management: LangGraph's state management (e.g., using StatefulGraph with a Pydantic or TypedDict state schema) will be used to pass data between nodes (query, context, code, execution results, error information, retry counts).
Control Flow: Conditional edges will implement the logic based on the state. For example, after the code execution node, an edge condition will check ExecutionResult.status. If 'error', it transitions to an error handling/analysis node; if 'success', it transitions to the end or a subsequent step (like analysis/visualization). The iterative refinement loop (Section 6.3) will be implemented using cycles in the graph.
Graph API Style: The workflow definition (potentially parsed from config.yaml's workflows section) will explicitly define nodes as functions/methods operating on the state, and the edges (including conditional logic) connecting them. This makes the execution flow transparent and easier to debug.
Configuration Example (workflows section in config.yaml): The YAML would define the sequence and connections, referencing the named components defined elsewhere in the config (e.g., component_ref: components.my_retriever).
7.2. Multi-Agent System Architecture ProposalFor more complex or conversational interactions, a multi-agent system can be configured.
Structure: A common pattern involves a "Coordinator" agent that manages the overall task and delegates sub-tasks to specialized agents.
Coordinator Agent: Receives the initial user request. Interprets the goal and decides which specialist agent(s) to invoke. Manages the state across multiple turns (e.g., holding onto data retrieved by one agent to pass to another).
Specialized Agents:

DataQueryingAgent: Focuses on the core NLQ flow: query refinement -> context retrieval -> code generation -> execution -> iterative refinement. Uses RetrievalComponent, CodeGenerationComponent, CodeExecutionComponent as its primary tools.
DataAnalysisAgent: Takes structured data (e.g., from the DataQueryingAgent) and an analysis request (e.g., "summarize this", "calculate correlations"). Uses the AnalysisComponent (configured for code-gen or predefined functions) as a tool.
DataVisualizationAgent: Takes structured data and a visualization request (e.g., "plot sales over time", "create a bar chart by region"). Uses the VisualizationComponent as a tool.


Tool Usage: The core dataqa components (Section 3) serve as the fundamental "tools" that these agents utilize to perform their tasks. The agent framework (initially LangGraph's agent capabilities, later potentially CrewAI, Autogen) is responsible for providing the LLM with the available tools and orchestrating their use based on the LLM's reasoning.
This separation of concerns allows for building more sophisticated applications where different agents handle distinct parts of a larger problem.7.3. Framework Abstraction Layer DesignA critical design requirement is to avoid tightly coupling the core dataqa components to LangGraph, enabling future support for other orchestration frameworks (CrewAI, Autogen, Pydantic AI, etc.) with minimal refactoring.
Boundary Definition: A clear separation must exist between the core components and the orchestration layer. Core components (LLM, Retrieval, Code Gen/Exec, Analysis, Viz) must be framework-agnostic. Their public interfaces (execute methods, input/output data structures like ExecutionResult, AnalysisResult) should not depend on LangGraph state or agent tool definitions.
Adapter Layers: Introduce adapters or wrappers that bridge the gap between the generic component interface and the specific requirements of an orchestration framework.

For LangGraph Nodes: These are Python functions (as required by LangGraph's Graph API style) that take the LangGraph state as input, extract necessary data, instantiate and call the appropriate core dataqa component's execute method, and update the LangGraph state with the results.
For Agent Tools (Generic): Define a standard way to represent components as tools. This typically involves creating a wrapper class (e.g., inheriting from LangChain's BaseTool or a similar concept in other frameworks) that includes:

A name and clear description (for the LLM to understand its purpose).
An input schema (e.g., using Pydantic) defining expected arguments.
A method (_run or similar) that parses the input, calls the corresponding core dataqa component's execute method, and returns the result in the format expected by the agent framework.




Configuration Role: The config.yaml specifies which core component implementations to use. The workflows or agents sections then define how these components are orchestrated using the chosen framework (e.g., LangGraph), referencing the components via their configured names and using the appropriate adapters.
Conceptual Framework Abstraction:LayerInterface ExampleFramework DependencyPurposeCore ComponentRetrievalComponent.retrieve(query: str) -> List[Document]NoneImplements core, reusable business logic (e.g., retrieval).Orchestration Adapter (LangGraph Node)def retrieval_node(state: GraphState) -> Partial:... calls component.retrieve...LangGraphAdapts component call to fit LangGraph's state-based node structure.Orchestration Adapter (Agent Tool)class RetrievalTool(BaseTool): name="retriever"... _run(...) calls component.retrieve...Agent FrameworkWraps component as a tool with description/schema for LLM agent usage.This explicit abstraction layer is key to achieving the desired flexibility. While it introduces a small amount of boilerplate (the adapters), it ensures that the core logic remains independent and reusable across different orchestration paradigms. Adding support for a new framework like CrewAI would involve writing new adapters (CrewAI tasks/tools) that call the existing core components, without modifying the components themselves.8. Data Analysis and Visualization ImplementationBeyond querying, dataqa aims to support subsequent analysis and visualization steps, configurable by the user.8.1. Configurable Modes: Code Generation vs. Pre-defined FunctionsBoth the AnalysisComponent and VisualizationComponent will support two primary modes of operation, selected via the mode key in their configuration:

mode: code_generation:

Mechanism: Leverages an LLM (configured via llm_provider_ref) and specific prompt templates to generate executable code (typically Python) for the requested analysis (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy) or visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.).
Execution: The generated code might be returned as a string, or potentially executed directly using an InMemoryCodeExecutor component (if configured and security permits) to produce the actual result (e.g., a summary statistic, a chart image).
Pros: Highly flexible, can potentially handle novel analysis/visualization requests not explicitly coded.
Cons: Relies on LLM's ability to generate correct and efficient code, potentially less reliable, harder to validate, may have security implications if executing arbitrary code. Requires careful prompt engineering.



mode: predefined_functions:

Mechanism: Uses a library of pre-written Python functions provided by the user or included with dataqa. The component needs logic to map the user's natural language request (e.g., "calculate the average", "plot a bar chart") to the appropriate function call.
Configuration: Requires specifying the location (module path, class reference) of the predefined function library. Functions within this library must adhere to a standardized interface (e.g., accept data in a specific format like a Pandas DataFrame, accept parameters).
Pros: Reliable, predictable, fast execution for known tasks. Easier to test and validate. More secure as it only executes trusted code.
Cons: Limited flexibility; can only perform analyses/visualizations for which functions have been explicitly implemented. Requires upfront development effort for the function library.


The configuration (config.yaml) will dictate which mode is active for each component instance, allowing users to mix and match (e.g., use code generation for analysis but predefined functions for standard charts).8.2. Component Interface and Result StructuresThe interfaces for these components need to handle diverse inputs and outputs.
Inputs: Typically accept the data resulting from the querying step (e.g., a list of dictionaries, a Pandas DataFrame) and the user's natural language request for analysis or visualization.
Outputs: Need structured result objects to convey the outcome clearly.

AnalysisResult: A data structure (e.g., a Pydantic model) containing fields like:

result_type: Enum/string indicating the type of result (e.g., 'dataframe', 'text_summary', 'json', 'python_code').
data: The actual analysis result (e.g., the DataFrame, the summary string).
error: Error information if the analysis failed.


VisualizationResult: A data structure containing fields like:

result_type: Enum/string (e.g., 'png_bytes', 'jpeg_bytes', 'svg_xml', 'plotly_json', 'matplotlib_fig', 'file_path', 'python_code').
data: The visualization data itself (e.g., image bytes, JSON spec, file path).
error: Error information if visualization failed.




Clear configuration options within the components section of config.yaml are needed for each mode (e.g., LLM settings and prompt paths for code_generation, function library path/reference and mapping logic for predefined_functions).9. Development Standards and Operational ConsiderationsAdherence to best practices in testing, documentation, and code quality is essential for building a robust and maintainable library. Operational aspects like processing modes must also be considered.9.1. Testing Strategy (Pytest)A comprehensive testing strategy using Pytest will be implemented:
Unit Tests (tests/unit): Focus on testing individual components in isolation. External dependencies (LLM APIs, KB stores, user execution APIs) will be mocked using libraries like pytest-mock or unittest.mock. These tests verify the internal logic, configuration parsing, and interface contracts of each component. pytest.mark can be used to categorize tests (e.g., pytest.mark.retrieval, pytest.mark.llm).
Integration Tests (tests/integration): Test the interaction between components within realistic scenarios, such as a complete data querying workflow or an agent performing a task. These tests may involve:

Setting up a minimal, temporary knowledge base (e.g., local vector store).
Using a mock implementation of the user's code execution API that simulates success and various error conditions.
Potentially making calls to a real (but sandboxed or low-cost) LLM endpoint for end-to-end validation, although extensive LLM testing can be slow and costly.
Testing the error handling and iterative refinement loops explicitly.


Fixtures: Pytest fixtures will be used extensively to provide reusable setup for component instances, sample configuration dictionaries, mock objects, and temporary data stores, keeping test code clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Coverage: Test coverage will be measured (pytest --cov) and tracked to ensure a high percentage of the codebase is exercised by tests.
This multi-layered approach ensures that individual units function correctly and that they integrate properly to deliver the intended end-to-end functionality.9.2. Documentation Plan (README and Sphinx)Clear documentation is vital for both users and contributors.
README.md: Serves as the primary entry point.

User Section: Provides essential information for users: project overview, key features, installation instructions (poetry install dataqa), a concise guide to the config.yaml structure, and simple examples demonstrating how to run a basic query workflow or agent.
Developer Section: Caters to contributors: guidelines for setting up a development environment (poetry install --with dev,docs), instructions for running tests (pytest), building documentation (cd docs && make html), information on the code style enforced by Ruff, and a high-level architectural overview with links to the more detailed Sphinx documentation.


Sphinx Documentation (docs/): Provides comprehensive, in-depth documentation.

API Reference: Automatically generated from docstrings (using Sphinx's autodoc extension) for all public modules, classes, and functions. Ensures documentation stays synchronized with the code.
Tutorials: Step-by-step guides covering common use cases: setting up different knowledge base backends, defining custom components, configuring retrieval strategies, building a LangGraph workflow, setting up a multi-agent system, configuring error handling and HIL.
Architecture Deep Dive: Detailed explanations of the core concepts: the component model, the abstraction layer for orchestration frameworks, the knowledge base structure, the querying flow, and the design rationale.
Configuration Guide: A detailed reference for all options available in config.yaml.


Separating the quick start (README) from the detailed reference (Sphinx) caters to different audience needs effectively.9.3. Linting and Formatting (Ruff)Code consistency will be maintained using Ruff.
Configuration: Ruff rules and settings will be defined in the [tool.ruff] section of pyproject.toml. This includes selecting base rule sets (e.g., equivalents of pylint, flake8, isort) and potentially enabling specific rules relevant to the project.
Automation: Ruff will be integrated into the development workflow using pre-commit. This automatically checks and potentially formats staged files before each commit, providing immediate feedback to developers.
CI Integration: The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) will also run Ruff checks on all pull requests to ensure compliance before merging.
Automated linting and formatting significantly improve code readability, reduce bugs, and make collaboration easier.9.4. Processing Modes: Real-time vs. BatchThe dataqa library architecture should be suitable for both interactive (real-time) and batch processing use cases.
Real-time Interaction: The design, particularly with LangGraph's state management and the potential for HIL integration, naturally supports conversational or request-response interactions. Success depends on the latency of components, especially the LLM and the user's code execution API. Component implementations should ideally be stateless or manage state carefully to handle concurrent requests if deployed in a multi-user environment.
Batch Processing: The library can be readily used for batch jobs (e.g., processing a list of queries from a file or database). This typically involves writing a script that iterates through the queries, invokes the configured dataqa workflow or agent for each, and collects the results. Key considerations for batch mode include:

Robust Error Handling: The system should be configured to log errors for specific queries but continue processing the rest of the batch, rather than failing entirely on the first error.
Configuration: Features like HIL should be disabled via configuration for unattended batch runs.
Logging: Effective logging is crucial for monitoring progress and diagnosing failures in long-running batch jobs.


Design Implications: The core component design is generally suitable for both modes. Ensuring components are stateless where possible enhances scalability for real-time use. Making features like HIL configurable via config.yaml allows tailoring the behavior for either interactive or batch scenarios. Logging should be structured to support both interactive debugging and post-mortem analysis of batch runs.
10. Conclusions and RecommendationsThe proposed design for the dataqa library provides a robust, flexible, and extensible foundation for building natural language querying, analysis, and visualization capabilities. Key strengths of this approach include:
Modularity: The component-based architecture allows for clear separation of concerns, independent development and testing of functionalities, and easy replacement or extension of parts (e.g., adding new LLM providers, retrieval methods, or execution backends).
Configurability: Driving behavior through a central YAML configuration file empowers users to customize and adapt the library to their specific needs (data sources, LLMs, desired workflows) without modifying the core codebase.
Framework Agnosticism: The explicit abstraction layer between core components and orchestration frameworks (initially LangGraph) is crucial for future-proofing. It ensures that the library is not locked into a single framework and can adapt to the evolving landscape of LLM orchestration tools with minimal disruption.
Iterative Refinement: The design incorporates mechanisms for handling code execution errors, analyzing them, and attempting automated correction through LLM feedback loops, enhancing the reliability of the generated code. Optional Human-in-the-Loop integration points further improve robustness.
Standardized Development Practices: Employing Poetry, Ruff, Pytest, and Sphinx promotes maintainability, collaboration, and usability through reproducible environments, consistent code quality, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation.
Recommendations:
Prioritize the Core Component Interfaces: Define and stabilize the interfaces (execute methods, input/output structures) for the core components early, ensuring they are framework-agnostic.
Implement the Abstraction Layer Carefully: Pay close attention to the design of the adapter layers for LangGraph (nodes) and generic agent tools to ensure clean separation from core components.
Focus on the Execution API Contract: Ensure the recommended JSON contract for the user's code execution API is clearly documented, emphasizing the need for structured error reporting (error_type, error_message) to enable effective iterative refinement.
Externalize Prompts: Implement prompt templates as external files (referenced in config.yaml) from the beginning to facilitate easier prompt engineering and optimization.
Build Incrementally: Start with the core data querying flow (retrieval, code generation, execution, basic error handling) using LangGraph, then layer on analysis, visualization, multi-agent systems, and support for other frameworks.
Invest in Testing: Rigorously test components individually (unit tests with mocks) and their interactions within workflows/agents (integration tests), particularly focusing on the error handling and refinement loops.
By following this design and these recommendations, the dataqa library can become a powerful and adaptable tool for bridging the gap between natural language and structured data interaction.

LLM Response - Open AI Deep Research
=======================================
Great, I’ll prepare a detailed step-by-step breakdown for building the `dataqa` library as a fully modular, YAML-configurable Python framework. It will support LangGraph-based workflows and agents with future extensibility in mind. I’ll include guidelines for component structure, config schema, knowledge base ingestion, LLM interaction, and execution feedback handling.

I’ll let you know once the blueprint is ready.

# dataqa Framework Design

**Overview:** The `dataqa` library will be a modular, YAML-driven Python framework for answering user questions about data. It will use multiple LLM-based agents (a coordinator plus specialized sub-agents) organized in a LangGraph-style workflow.  Users provide YAML or text assets (database schema, business rules, example Q&A, etc.) in a local or OpenSearch-backed “Asset Store.”  The system will generate SQL or Python code via LLM prompts (using Azure OpenAI by default) and execute it via a pluggable CodeExecution API.  The architecture follows modern agentic AI patterns: each agent has defined tools and roles, and a high-level coordinator orchestrates them ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20frameworks%20are%20AI%20agent,gen%20AI%20applications%20to%20function)) ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=crewAI%20is%20an%20open%20source,1)).  All components are configurable in YAML, and the design is extensible to future frameworks (e.g. CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic-AI) through abstract interfaces.

## 1. Configuration and Assets
- **YAML Config Files:** Use a hierarchical YAML configuration for all logic. For example, one might use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc) or a similar YAML loader to manage config namespaces ([Getting started | Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/#:~:text=Hydra%20is%20an%20open,a%20Hydra%20with%20multiple%20heads)).  A top-level `dataqa.yaml` could define global settings (e.g. LLM model parameters, execution settings, agent roles) and reference other files. Sub-files describe domain assets:
  - `schema.yaml` – database schema (tables, columns, datatypes).
  - `rules.yaml` – business rules, constraints, calculation definitions.
  - `examples.yaml` – example questions and answers.
  - `prompts.yaml` – prompt templates for querying, analysis, and visualization.
  Each of these assets is editable as YAML or text. The config loader should merge/override settings dynamically (e.g. via Hydra-style composition ([Getting started | Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/#:~:text=Hydra%20is%20an%20open,a%20Hydra%20with%20multiple%20heads))).
- **Asset Store Abstraction:** Define a `AssetStore` interface for retrieving assets (by keyword or query). Provide at least two implementations: a LocalFileStore (reads YAML/txt from a directory structure) and an OpenSearchStore (searches a local OpenSearch index of the assets for relevant snippets). This allows retrieval of relevant schema or examples for a given user question (a RAG-style approach). For example, a tool might query the AssetStore to fetch the `schema.yaml` and relevant business rules. The YAML config would specify which store to use and index settings.

## 2. Core Modules and Interfaces
- **LLM Client:** An abstract `LLMClient` interface (e.g. `generate(prompt:str) -> str`). Provide an `AzureOpenAIClient` implementation for Azure OpenAI GPT models. This client reads credentials from environment or YAML and handles rate-limiting, retries, and logging. The LLM client will be used by all agents to generate SQL or analysis code from natural language prompts.
- **Prompt Component:** A reusable component that constructs LLM prompts from user input, context assets, and prompt templates (from `prompts.yaml`). This prompt-builder should be configurable in YAML (templates with placeholders for schema, rules, examples, etc.). For example, the Data Querying agent might load a “SQL generation” prompt template, fill in the user question plus schema snippet, and call the LLM client.
- **Agent Base Class:** Define a base `Agent` class or interface (e.g. with methods `run(task:Task)` and `on_message()` if using conversational structure). Each agent has a name, a set of tools/components it can use, and access to the shared environment (assets, execution API).
- **Tool Abstraction:** Agents use “tools” to perform actions. Define a `Tool` base class (e.g. `perform(**kwargs)`). Tools can be things like:
  - `SQLExecutorTool` – generates or runs SQL (uses LLM or direct DB query).
  - `PythonExecutorTool` – executes Python code via the CodeExecution API.
  - `DataFrameTool` – runs queries on pandas dataframes.
  - `PlotTool` – generates data visualizations (e.g. produces Python plotting code).
  - `AssetRetrievalTool` – fetches schema/rules/examples from the AssetStore.
  Each tool implementation is registered in YAML (e.g. under `tools:` in the config), and the agent picks from these to complete tasks.
- **Code Executor:** Abstract a `CodeExecutor` component with `execute(code:str) -> ExecutionResult`. Provide at least:
  - **InMemoryExecutor** for testing (executes Python or SQL in-process).
  - **APIExecutor** which sends code to a user-defined execution endpoint (e.g. via HTTP) and returns output.
  The CodeExecutor handles execution, captures stdout/stderr, enforces timeouts, and can retry on failure. Execution errors trigger the error-handling logic (see section 5).
- **Base Interfaces:** All of the above (AssetStore, LLMClient, Agent, Tool, CodeExecutor) should be abstract base classes or protocols. Concrete implementations are selected via YAML config (for example, `agents: data_query_agent: type: DataQueryAgent, llm_client: azure, executor: api_based`).

## 3. Agents and Workflows
- **Coordinator Agent:** A top-level agent that orchestrates the multi-agent workflow. Its responsibilities include: interpreting the user question at a high level, deciding which sub-agents to invoke (querying, analysis, visualization), and combining their results. It may maintain global state or intermediate results. For example, given a question, the coordinator may send it to the Data Query Agent first.
- **Data Query Agent:** Specialized agent that focuses on retrieving the data. It:
  1. Fetches the schema and rules from the AssetStore.
  2. Uses the LLM (with a “generate SQL” prompt) to produce a SQL query or pandas code answering the question.
  3. Validates or reviews the generated query (optionally re-run LLM if results seem invalid).
  4. Passes the query code to the CodeExecutor for execution, obtaining raw data.
- **Data Analysis Agent:** Takes the raw data result and performs any additional analysis. This could include aggregations, statistical calculations, or data cleaning. It can either call predefined analytics functions (e.g. Pandas, NumPy) or generate code via LLM (using an “analysis” prompt template). Output is an analysis result (e.g. a summary table).
- **Data Visualization Agent:** Given the (possibly filtered or aggregated) data, this agent generates visual output. It might either:
  - Use LLM to propose a chart (with a prompt like “generate matplotlib code to plot this data”).
  - Or call a built-in plotting function.
  The output should be code for a chart (e.g. Python/Matplotlib/Plotly) which is then executed by the CodeExecutor to produce an image or chart data.
- **Graph-Style Workflow:** The agents are connected in a directed graph (LangGraph-style). For example: User → Coordinator → (DataQuery → Executor → DataAnalysis → Executor → DataVisualization → Executor) → final answer. Implement this as a workflow definition (could use a library like [networkx] or a simple DAG runner). Each node in the graph is an agent or tool action. This flow can be defined in code or even in YAML (e.g. listing steps and dependencies).
- **YAML-Driven Design:** All agent/task flows and tool chains should be configurable via YAML. For example, the YAML might specify:
  ```yaml
  agents:
    coordinator:
      role: orchestrator
      tools: [prompt_builder]
    data_query:
      role: query
      tools: [AssetRetrieval, SQLExecutor, LLMClient]
    data_analysis:
      role: analysis
      tools: [DataFrameTool, PythonExecutor]
    data_visualization:
      role: visualization
      tools: [PlotTool, PythonExecutor]
  ```
  This allows adding new agents or tools by editing the config, without code changes.

## 4. Tool and Component Hierarchy
- **Pluggable Tool Modules:** Organize tools in a hierarchical package structure (e.g. `dataqa/tools/code_executor`, `dataqa/tools/dataframe`, `dataqa/tools/plotting`). Each sub-package can have multiple implementations. For example:
  - `dataqa/tools/code_executor/base.py` – defines the interface.
    `dataqa/tools/code_executor/in_memory.py` and `api_based.py` – two implementations.
  - `dataqa/tools/asset_store/base.py` – interface.
    `local.py` (reads YAML), `opensearch.py`.
  - `dataqa/tools/llm/base.py` – interface.
    `azure_openai.py`.
  - `dataqa/tools/prompt/base.py` – templating logic.
- **Generic LLM Generation Component:** A reusable prompt wrapper that can be used by any agent. For example, a `LangGraphLLMTool` that takes input variables (question, schema, rules, examples) and a template, then returns generated text. This ensures prompt logic is standardized across agents.
- **LangGraph Graph API Style Execution:** Implement a `GraphExecutor` that can run a LangGraph (workflow) of agent steps. Each node is a function call (agent or tool), edges define data flow. This mirrors LangGraph’s style of defining workflows as graphs of steps, making the execution order clear.
- **Batch vs. Real-time Modes:** Support two modes:
  - *Real-time mode:* Single-question, interactive. The user submits a question and the system runs the coordinator agent pipeline immediately and returns results. Use synchronous LLM calls with low latency.
  - *Batch mode:* Multiple questions or large jobs. The system can queue queries, possibly run agents in parallel or sequence without user waiting. Here, agents might save intermediate outputs. Configurations (in YAML) specify mode, batch size, parallelism. This affects how the LangGraph is instantiated (e.g. enabling a for-loop in the graph).

## 5. Error Handling and Human-in-the-Loop
- **Retry Logic:** All external calls (LLM generation, code execution, OpenSearch queries) should have retry wrappers. For example, the CodeExecutor can retry a failed execution up to *N* times (configurable) with exponential backoff. Similarly, LLM calls should catch timeouts or API errors and retry. This follows best practices for production AI systems ([Pydantic AI: Agent Framework. PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework… | by Bhavik Jikadara | AI Agent Insider | Medium](https://medium.com/ai-agent-insider/pydantic-ai-agent-framework-02b138e8db71#:~:text=,retries%20and%20structured%20exception%20management)).
- **Validation Checks:** After code execution (SQL or Python), automatically check results for anomalies (e.g. empty result when not expected, SQL syntax errors, runtime exceptions). If the validation fails, the agent should either:
  1. Automatically retry generation with revised prompt (e.g. append “The previous attempt failed, please correct errors.” to the prompt), or
  2. Failover to a human reviewer.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Fallback:** If retries exceed threshold, the framework should escalate. For example, it could log the failure, halt execution, and alert a human. In a deployed UI, this might pop up a message like “An error occurred. Please review.”. The design should allow plugging in a “Human Review” step in the graph when needed.
- **Structured Exception Handling:** Use custom exception types (e.g. `LLMGenerationError`, `ExecutionError`, `ValidationError`) so that the workflow can branch on error type. For example, a `CodeExecutor` might raise `SyntaxErrorExecution`, and the coordinator can catch that and decide to ask the DataQueryAgent to regenerate the SQL.
- **Audit Logging:** Every agent action, prompt, and result should be logged (with correlation IDs). This helps in debugging errors and for manual review. Logging configuration (verbose vs info) should be in YAML.

## 6. Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
- **Specialized Agent Roles:** Follow the “crew” concept: each agent has a clear role and complementary expertise ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=crewAI%20is%20an%20open%20source,1)) ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=multiagent%20systems%20,distinct%20execution%20paths%20are%20required)). The DataQueryAgent handles schema and SQL; the DataAnalysisAgent handles transformations; the VisualizationAgent handles charts. The CoordinatorAgent plays a “manager” role, delegating tasks and collecting results.
- **Tool-Oriented Agents:** Agents use tools rather than doing all work themselves. For example, DataQueryAgent doesn’t parse schema itself but calls `AssetRetrievalTool` for schema and then `LLMClient` to generate SQL. This decouples functionality and makes it easy to swap components (tool-based orchestration ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20frameworks%20are%20AI%20agent,gen%20AI%20applications%20to%20function))).
- **Planning and Iteration:** Implement simple planning: e.g., allow an agent to loop: “If the previous action failed or result incomplete, try a different tool or re-prompt.” This reflects agentic frameworks’ iterative refinement ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20frameworks%20are%20AI%20agent,gen%20AI%20applications%20to%20function)). For instance, if DataAnalysisAgent’s first LLM attempt at analysis code is wrong, have it retry with extra context.
- **Shared Memory or Context:** Agents share context through the workflow graph. For example, the raw query result (dataframe) is passed from the DataQuery step to the DataAnalysis agent. Use a shared data structure or graph edge payloads to pass intermediate results.
- **Agent Communication (Optional):** If implementing as true “agents”, allow them to send messages to each other via the Coordinator. For example, if DataVisualization needs clarification (“should I highlight trends or absolute values?”), it can “ask” the Coordinator, which then could prompt the user or use a system prompt. (Frameworks like CrewAI allow agent chat; we can design a simplified interaction pattern.)

## 7. Extensibility and Future Framework Support
- **Framework-Agnostic Design:** Structure the code so that agent orchestration is decoupled from specific libraries. For example, do not hardcode calls to CrewAI or AutoGen APIs. Instead, define abstract `Agent` and `Workflow` interfaces. That way, one could later implement a backend that uses CrewAI’s orchestration under the hood, or swap to AutoGen agents, by writing adapter classes that conform to our interfaces.
- **Plugin Hooks:** Allow third-party tool packages. For example, an extension pack might add new analysis tools or support a new LLM provider. The config can list these plugins. Use entry points or a plugin registry to dynamically load them.
- **Minimal Changes for New Frameworks:** To “support additional frameworks with minimal changes”, rely on interfaces. E.g. if integrating CrewAI, one could create a `CrewAIAdapter` that converts our Agent calls into CrewAI crew tasks. By keeping business logic (data QA workflows) separate, the core doesn’t need to change when plugging in a new orchestration engine.
- **Code Reuse:** Ensure tools and components are reusable in agents or as standalone workflows. For instance, the SQLExecutorTool could be used by any agent, and the LLM prompt builder is generic.

## 8. Data Querying, Analysis, Visualization Workflow
- **Data Querying Flow:** The YAML config can define how a natural language question is turned into data retrieval:
  - Load `schema.yaml` and relevant rules/examples via AssetStore.
  - Format a prompt like: “Given this database schema and business rules, write a SQL query to answer: ‘…question…’.”
  - Call LLMClient → get SQL.
  - Execute SQL via CodeExecutor → get result table.
  - If SQL fails, re-run with additional instruction.
  - Return table.
- **Data Analysis Flow:** If the question requires calculations beyond direct query:
  - DataQueryAgent can output initial results to a Pandas DataFrame.
  - DataAnalysisAgent loads the DataFrame (via a DataFrameTool) and either calls known analysis functions (configured in YAML) or asks the LLM to generate Python to process the DataFrame.
  - Example: “Analyze the data to compute averages by category.” The prompt could include the DataFrame schema. The agent runs the code and returns new table/metrics.
- **Visualization Flow:**
  - DataVisualizationAgent takes the final data (or a subset) and generates a chart. The YAML can specify preferred chart types. The agent might prompt: “Generate Python code to plot this table with Matplotlib.”
  - Execute code to produce an image or embed code.
  - The final answer returned to the user includes the chart and any textual summary.
- **Workflow Patterns:** Implement common patterns like “Query → Analyze → Visualize” chains. The LangGraph API style means each step’s output is the next step’s input.

## 9. Configuration Format Example
A sample `dataqa.yaml` could look like:
```yaml
# dataqa.yaml
global:
  mode: real-time        # or batch
  llm_model: "gpt-4o"
  max_retries: 3
  executor: api

agents:
  coordinator:
    class: CoordinatorAgent
    tools: [PromptTool]
  data_query_agent:
    class: DataQueryAgent
    tools: [AssetRetrievalTool, PromptTool, CodeExecutorTool]
  data_analysis_agent:
    class: DataAnalysisAgent
    tools: [DataFrameTool, PromptTool, CodeExecutorTool]
  data_viz_agent:
    class: DataVisualizationAgent
    tools: [PlotTool, PromptTool, CodeExecutorTool]

assets:
  schema: "assets/schema.yaml"
  rules: "assets/rules.yaml"
  examples: "assets/examples.yaml"
```
This shows how agents, tools, and assets are wired in YAML. Every name (class or file path) is configurable, enabling easy extension.

## 10. Development Environment and Best Practices
- **Dependency Management:** Use Poetry to create an isolated Python environment and manage dependencies. The `pyproject.toml` should list dependencies like `openai`, `PyYAML` (or `hydra-core`), `requests` (for API calls), and any optional libs (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
- **Linting and Formatting:** Enforce style with Ruff (or Black/Flake8). Configure a `ruff.toml` to lint Python code and optionally check YAML schema files. This ensures code consistency and catches errors early.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive Pytest suites. For example, tests for: YAML config loading, LLM prompt generation (mocking LLM calls), code execution (mock or use a dummy API), and end-to-end workflows (mock agents and check data flows). Use fixtures to simulate the AssetStore and external APIs.
- **Continuous Integration:** Set up GitHub Actions (or similar) to run `ruff --fix`, `pytest`, and build Sphinx docs on each commit/pull request.
- **Documentation:** Use Sphinx for docs generation. Document all modules, classes, and YAML config schema. Provide a `docs/usage.rst` with examples: e.g. “How to ask a question”, showing sample YAML and agent flow. Include a high-level architecture diagram (optional).
- **README:** The README should summarize `dataqa` features, show installation (via Poetry), and provide a quickstart example YAML and code snippet. It should also detail how to define the YAML assets and run a query. Developer docs should explain how to extend the system with new tools or agents.

## 11. Summary of Key Abstractions
- **Interfaces:**
  - `IConfigLoader` (parses YAML),
  - `IAssetStore`,
  - `ILLMClient`,
  - `ICodeExecutor`,
  - `ITool`,
  - `IAgent`,
  - `IWorkflowExecutor`.
- **Implementations:**
  - `YamlConfigLoader`,
  - `LocalAssetStore`/`OpenSearchAssetStore`,
  - `AzureOpenAIClient`,
  - `InMemoryCodeExecutor`/`ApiCodeExecutor`,
  - Various tools (SQLExecutor, DataFrameTool, etc.),
  - Agents (CoordinatorAgent, DataQueryAgent, etc.),
  - `LangGraphExecutor`.
- **Config Structure:** Key YAML sections (`global`, `agents`, `assets`, etc.), illustrated above.
- **Workflow Patterns:** Sequence of “understand → query → retrieve → analyze → visualize” with fallback loops. Each pattern corresponds to an agent chain.
- **Error Handling:** Use retries and escalation. Inspired by Pydantic AI’s focus on production robustness (type-safety and retries) ([Pydantic AI: Agent Framework. PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework… | by Bhavik Jikadara | AI Agent Insider | Medium](https://medium.com/ai-agent-insider/pydantic-ai-agent-framework-02b138e8db71#:~:text=,retries%20and%20structured%20exception%20management)).
- **Extensibility:** The design keeps core logic separate from any one multi-agent library (CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic AI), enabling future plugging-in. For example, CrewAI and AutoGen are both multi-agent orchestration frameworks ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=crewAI%20is%20an%20open%20source,1)) ([GitHub - microsoft/autogen: A programming framework for agentic AI  PyPi: autogen-agentchat Discord: https://aka.ms/autogen-discord Office Hour: https://aka.ms/autogen-officehour](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen#:~:text=AutoGen)); our framework only assumes abstract agent calls, so it can adapt to them with adapters.

In summary, `dataqa` will consist of well-defined Python modules (config loader, asset store, LLM client, code executor, tools, agents) connected by YAML-configured workflows.  It will follow agentic design principles (tool use and coordination) ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20frameworks%20are%20AI%20agent,gen%20AI%20applications%20to%20function)) ([What is crewAI? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/crew-ai#:~:text=multiagent%20systems%20,distinct%20execution%20paths%20are%20required)), provide robust error handling with retries and human fallback ([Pydantic AI: Agent Framework. PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework… | by Bhavik Jikadara | AI Agent Insider | Medium](https://medium.com/ai-agent-insider/pydantic-ai-agent-framework-02b138e8db71#:~:text=,retries%20and%20structured%20exception%20management)), and use modern development practices (Poetry, Ruff, Pytest, Sphinx).  This structure will guide an LLM to generate the actual code for each component, ensuring a modular and extensible QA system for databases.

    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, **kwargs) -> Any: ...
```

## 4. Data-Querying Pipeline

1. **Query Rewriting**
   - Component: `QueryRewriter` (LLM-based)
   - Input: raw user question → Output: normalized/focused query

2. **Asset Retrieval**
   - Use `RetrievalBase` to fetch:
     - schema snippets
     - query→code examples
     - business rules
   - Assemble into context bundle

3. **Prompt Composition**
   - Template driven (Jinja2):
     ```
     You are a SQL generation assistant.
     Schema:
     {{ schema }}
     Business rules:
     {{ rules }}
     Examples:
     {{ examples }}
     Question:
     {{ rewritten_query }}
     Generate code only.
     ```

4. **Code Generation**
   - Call `LlmComponent.generate(prompt)`

5. **Code Execution**
   - Pass to `CodeExecutor.run(code)`
   - Handle success: return dataframe or JSON
   - On error: capture exception, if `retry_on_error` then automatically regenerate with “error context” appended.

6. **Result Wrapping**
   - Always return a standardized `QueryResult` object:
     ```python
     class QueryResult(NamedTuple):
         data: Any
         code: str
         logs: List[str]
     ```

---

## 5. Data-Analysis & Visualization

- **Analysis**
  - Two modes:
    1. **Prebuilt functions**: e.g. `mean, groupby, pivot_table` wrappers
    2. **LLM-generated code**: similar pipeline to querying, but prompt tuned for pandas/matplotlib

- **Visualization**
  - Prebuilt chart functions (e.g. `bar_chart(data, x, y)`)
  - Or generate code via LLM (prompt includes “Use matplotlib to plot…”)

- **Component Hooks**
  - `AnalysisComponent`, `VisualizationComponent` ← `BaseComponent`
  - Each takes config to choose “mode: prebuilt|llm” plus parameters

---

## 6. Workflow Graphs (LangGraph-based)

1. **Define Nodes**
   - Each component (QueryRewriter, Retrieval, LLM, Executor, Analyzer, Visualizer) is a node.

2. **Define Edges**
   - Query → Rewrite → Retrieve → Generate → Execute → Analyze → Visualize

3. **Config-Driven Graph**
   ```yaml
   workflows:
     simple_query:
       nodes:
         - name: rewrite
           component: QueryRewriter
         - name: retrieve
           component: InMemoryRetrieval
         - name: generate
           component: OpenAIComponent
         - name: execute
           component: ApiExecutor
       edges:
         - [rewrite, retrieve]
         - [retrieve, generate]
         - [generate, execute]
   ```

4. **Workflow Runner**
   - Reads config, instantiates components, runs graph.

5. **Pluggability**
   - To swap in CrewAI’s orchestrator, write an adapter that takes the same graph config.

---

## 7. Agent Definitions

- **High-Level Agent**
  - Delegates to sub-agents:
    - **DataQueryAgent**
    - **DataAnalysisAgent**
    - **DataVizAgent**

- **Agent API**
  ```python
  class Agent(ABC):
      def __init__(self, tools: Dict[str, BaseComponent]): ...
      @abstractmethod
      def run(self, input: str) -> Any: ...
  ```

- **Multi-Agent Flow**
  1. User question → HighLevelAgent
  2. Based on analysis: call DataQueryAgent or DataAnalysisAgent, etc.
  3. Chained back-and-forth until final output.

- **Tool Registration**
  - Each Agent constructor takes a `tools` dict populated from components.

---

## 8. Error Handling & Retries

- **Centralized Error Types**
  - `CodeExecutionError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `RetrievalError`
- **Retry Decorator**
  - Applies to any component with `retry_on_error` from config
- **User Feedback Loop**
  - On repeated failures, Agent can ask the user for clarification.

---

## 9. Extensibility & Adapter Pattern

- **Interface Definitions**
  - Every component interface in `components/interfaces.py`
- **Registration Mechanism**
  - Entry points or a simple factory:
    ```python
    COMPONENT_REGISTRY = {
      "openai": OpenAIComponent,
      "in_memory": InMemoryRetrieval,
      ...
    }
    ```
- **Adding New Framework**
  1. Implement the interface
  2. Register in `COMPONENT_REGISTRY`
  3. Update config schema to accept new type

---

## 10. Asset Ingestion & Retrieval Index

1. **Parsers**
   - YAML/TXT → normalized `SchemaDoc`, `ExampleDoc`, `RuleDoc`
2. **Indexers**
   - For local: simple key-value store
   - For Opensearch: bulk ingest API wrapper
3. **Retriever**
   - Embedding-based or keyword matching

---

## 11. Testing & CI

- **pytest**
  - Unit tests for each component interface
  - End-to-end: config → workflow run on toy CSV
- **Linting**
  - `ruff --fix`
- **Type Checking**
  - `mypy dataqa/`

---

## 12. Documentation & Examples

- **README**
  - Quickstart:
    ```python
    from dataqa import DataQALibrary
    lib = DataQALibrary(config="config.yml")
    result = lib.query("Show me total sales by region")
    lib.visualize(result.data, kind="bar")
    ```
- **Sphinx**
  - Auto-generate API, plus how-to guides for:
    - Adding a new LLM provider
    - Writing custom components
    - Building an Agent vs. Workflow

---

### Next Steps

1. **Feed this plan** (or chunks of it) to your LLM, asking it to scaffold each module.
2. **Iterate**: once code is generated, run tests and refine configs.
3. **Extend**: drop in new orchestrators (CrewAI, Autogen) by writing thin adapters.

With this blueprint, your LLM has a clear map—every package, module, config file, class hierarchy, and workflow definition it needs to generate the full `dataqa` library in a **configuration-driven**, **extensible** way.

===================================================
LLM Response - Claude Sonnet
==================================================
I'll help you create a detailed breakdown that you can feed to an LLM to generate your entire `dataqa` library. Based on your requirements, I'll organize this into a comprehensive plan with architecture, components, and implementation steps.

# DataQA Library Design and Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Structure and Setup

First, let's establish the foundational project structure:

```
dataqa/
├── pyproject.toml       # Poetry dependency management
├── README.md           # Usage instructions and developer guide
├── .github/            # CI/CD workflows
├── docs/               # Sphinx documentation
│   ├── conf.py
│   ├── index.rst
│   └── ...
├── dataqa/             # Main package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config/         # Configuration handling
│   ├── core/           # Core components

│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
└── tests/              # Test suite
    ├── conftest.py
    └── ...
```

## 2. Core Architecture

The library will be built around these key architectural principles:

1. **Component-based design**: All functionality will be built as modular components
2. **Provider abstraction**: Framework-specific implementations (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.) will be abstracted
3. **Config-driven**: System behavior will be configurable via YAML
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new components, providers, and features

## 3. Component System Design

Create a robust component system that allows:
- Base components that can be used in both workflows and as agent tools
- Registration/discovery mechanism
- Composition and chaining of components

### Base Component Structure

```python
# Base component all others will inherit from
class Component:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config

    async def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute component functionality"""
        pass

    def to_tool(self):
        """Convert component to a tool format for agent use"""
        pass
```

### Component Registry

Create a component registry system that allows:
- Dynamic discovery of components
- Configuration of components via YAML
- Instantiation of components based on configuration

## 4. Knowledge Base System

Design the knowledge base system for storing and retrieving:
- Schema information
- Business rules
- Example query-code pairs

The system should support:
- Multiple storage backends (OpenSearch, local storage)
- Multiple retrieval methods (dense, sparse, hybrid, tag-based)
- Flexible document schema and indexing

## 5. LLM Integration

Create a modular LLM integration system:
- Support for multiple providers (AzureOpenAI initially, others later)
- Consistent interface for prompting
- Streaming support
- Prompt templating and management

## 6. Workflow System

Design the workflow system using LangGraph:
- Abstract the LangGraph specifics into a provider implementation
- Define standard nodes for common operations
- Support for conditional branches and loops
- Error handling and recovery

## 7. Agent System

Design the multi-agent system:
- Orchestration agent that can delegate to specialized agents
- Specialized agents for data querying, analysis, visualization
- Tool integration for both built-in and user-defined functionality
- Memory and state management

## 8. Code Generation and Execution

Design the code generation and execution system:
- LLM-based code generation for different tasks
- Code validation and security checking
- Execution via API or local runtime
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

## 9. Configuration System

Create a robust configuration system:
- YAML-based configuration
- Environment variable substitution
- Configuration validation
- Default configurations

## Detailed Implementation Plan

Now, let's break down the implementation into detailed steps:

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for your DataQA library. This should serve as an excellent guide that you can feed to an LLM to generate the entire library.


# DataQA Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Components

### Step 1.1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Poetry project with dependencies
   ```bash
   poetry init
   poetry add pydantic pyyaml langchain langchain-core langgraph azure-openai
   poetry add --group dev pytest pytest-cov sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme ruff pre-commit
   ```

2. Set up basic project structure
   ```bash
   mkdir -p dataqa/config dataqa/core dataqa/components dataqa/agents dataqa/workflows dataqa/knowledge dataqa/utils
   mkdir -p tests docs
   ```

3. Create base configuration and entry points
   ```bash
   touch dataqa/__init__.py dataqa/config/__init__.py dataqa/core/__init__.py
   ```

### Step 1.2: Configuration System
1. Create configuration schema classes using Pydantic
2. Implement YAML loader with environment variable substitution
3. Create configuration validation functionality
4. Add default configurations

Example configuration structure:
```python
# dataqa/config/schema.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union, Any

class LLMConfig(BaseModel):
    provider: str = "azure_openai"
    model: str
    api_version: Optional[str] = None
    api_key: Optional[str] = None
    endpoint: Optional[str] = None
    # Additional provider-specific fields

class KnowledgeBaseConfig(BaseModel):
    provider: str = "local"  # "local" or "opensearch"
    # Provider-specific configurations
    retrieval_methods: List[str] = ["dense"]  # "dense", "sparse", "hybrid", "tag"

class ComponentConfig(BaseModel):
    type: str
    config: Dict[str, Any] = {}

class AgentConfig(BaseModel):
    type: str
    llm: LLMConfig
    tools: List[str] = []
    # Agent-specific configurations

class WorkflowConfig(BaseModel):
    type: str
    components: Dict[str, ComponentConfig]
    # Workflow-specific configurations

class DataQAConfig(BaseModel):
    knowledge_base: KnowledgeBaseConfig
    llm: LLMConfig
    components: Dict[str, ComponentConfig] = {}
    agents: Dict[str, AgentConfig] = {}
    workflows: Dict[str, WorkflowConfig] = {}
```

### Step 1.3: Base Component System
1. Create abstract base Component class
2. Implement component registration mechanism
3. Build component discovery functionality
4. Add component factory for instantiation from configuration

Example component system:
```python
# dataqa/core/component.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional, Type, ClassVar, Dict

class Component(ABC):
    """Base component class that all components will inherit from."""

    # Class registry for component types
    _registry: ClassVar[Dict[str, Type["Component"]]] = {}

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config

    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """Execute the component's main functionality."""
        pass

    def to_tool(self, name: str, description: str):
        """Convert this component to a tool usable by agents."""
        # Implementation to create a tool representation
        pass

    @classmethod
    def register(cls, component_type: str):
        """Decorator to register a component class."""
        def decorator(component_cls: Type["Component"]):
            cls._registry[component_type] = component_cls
            return component_cls
        return decorator

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, component_type: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> "Component":
        """Create a component instance from type and configuration."""
        if component_type not in cls._registry:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown component type: {component_type}")

        component_cls = cls._registry[component_type]
        return component_cls(config)
```

### Step 1.4: LLM Integration
1. Create LLM provider abstraction
2. Implement AzureOpenAI provider
3. Add prompt templates system
4. Build conversation management utilities

Example LLM integration:
```python
# dataqa/core/llm.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Type, ClassVar

class LLMProvider(ABC):
    """Base class for LLM providers."""

    _registry: ClassVar[Dict[str, Type["LLMProvider"]]] = {}

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config

    @abstractmethod
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Generate text from a prompt."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def generate_streaming(self, prompt: str, **kwargs):
        """Generate streaming text from a prompt."""
        pass

    @classmethod
    def register(cls, provider_name: str):
        """Decorator to register an LLM provider."""
        def decorator(provider_cls: Type["LLMProvider"]):
            cls._registry[provider_name] = provider_cls
            return provider_cls
        return decorator

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, provider_name: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> "LLMProvider":
        """Create an LLM provider instance."""
        if provider_name not in cls._registry:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown LLM provider: {provider_name}")

        provider_cls = cls._registry[provider_name]
        return provider_cls(config)

@LLMProvider.register("azure_openai")
class AzureOpenAIProvider(LLMProvider):
    """AzureOpenAI provider implementation."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize Azure OpenAI SDK client

    async def generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Implementation using Azure OpenAI
        pass

    async def generate_streaming(self, prompt: str, **kwargs):
        # Implementation for streaming using Azure OpenAI
        pass
```

## Phase 2: Knowledge Base and Retrieval

### Step 2.1: Knowledge Base Interface
1. Define knowledge base provider interface
2. Implement local file-based knowledge base
3. Prepare for OpenSearch implementation
4. Create document schema for business rules, examples, and DB schema

Example knowledge base system:

class Document:
    """Base document class for knowledge base items."""

    def __init__(self, content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any], doc_type: str, tags: List[str] = None):
        self.content = content
        self.metadata = metadata
        self.doc_type = doc_type  # "schema", "rule", "example"
        self.tags = tags or []

class KnowledgeBase(ABC):
    """Base class for knowledge base providers."""

    _registry: ClassVar[Dict[str, Type["KnowledgeBase"]]] = {}

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.config = config

    @abstractmethod
    async def add_document(self, document: Document) -> str:
        """Add a document to the knowledge base."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def retrieve(self, query: str, doc_type: Optional[str] = None,
                      retrieval_method: str = "dense", top_k: int = 5,
                      tags: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> List[Document]:
        """Retrieve documents from the knowledge base."""
        pass

    @classmethod
    def register(cls, provider_name: str):
        """Decorator to register a knowledge base provider."""
        def decorator(provider_cls: Type["KnowledgeBase"]):
            cls._registry[provider_name] = provider_cls
            return provider_cls
        return decorator

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, provider_name: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> "KnowledgeBase":
        """Create a knowledge base provider instance."""
        if provider_name not in cls._registry:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown knowledge base provider: {provider_name}")

        provider_cls = cls._registry[provider_name]
        return provider_cls(config)

@KnowledgeBase.register("local")
class LocalKnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):
    """Local file-based knowledge base implementation."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize local storage and embedding model

    async def add_document(self, document: Document) -> str:
        # Implementation for adding to local storage
        pass

    async def retrieve(self, query: str, doc_type: Optional[str] = None,
                      retrieval_method: str = "dense", top_k: int = 5,
                      tags: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> List[Document]:

@Component.register("query_rewriter")
class QueryRewriterComponent(Component):
    """Component for rewriting and refining user queries."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize LLM for query rewriting

    async def execute(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Rewrite the query for better retrieval."""
        original_query = context.get("query", "")

        # Use LLM to rewrite the query
        rewritten_query = await self._rewrite_query(original_query)

        # Update context with rewritten query
        context["original_query"] = original_query
        context["query"] = rewritten_query

        return context

    async def _rewrite_query(self, query: str) -> str:

    """Base class for code execution components."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        super().__init__(config)

    @abstractmethod
    async def execute_code(self, code: str, language: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute code and return results."""
        pass

    async def execute(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute code from context and update with results."""
        code = context.get("generated_code", "")
        language = context.get("language", "python")

        # Execute the code
        result = await self.execute_code(code, language, context)

        # Update context with execution results
        context["execution_result"] = result.get("result")
        context["execution_success"] = result.get("success", False)
        context["execution_error"] = result.get("error")

        return context

@Component.register("in_memory_executor")
class InMemoryCodeExecutor(CodeExecutor):

    async def execute_code(self, code: str, language: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implementation for in-memory execution
        pass

@Component.register("api_executor")
class APICodeExecutor(CodeExecutor):

    async def execute_code(self, code: str, language: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implementation for API-based execution
        pass

## Phase 7: Workflow and Agent Systems

### Step 7.1: LangGraph Workflow Integration
1. Create LangGraph provider abstraction
2. Implement workflow builder using components
3. Add state management and persistence
4. Build error handling and recovery mechanisms

Example workflow system:
```python
# dataqa/workflows/langgraph_provider.py
from typing import Dict, Any, List
from langgraph.graph import Graph, StateGraph
from dataqa.core.component import Component

class LangGraphWorkflow:
    """LangGraph-based workflow implementation."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any], components: Dict[str, Component]):
        self.config = config
        self.components = components
        self.graph = self._build_graph()

    def _build_graph(self) -> StateGraph:
        """Build the LangGraph workflow graph."""
        # Initialize LangGraph StateGraph
        graph = StateGraph()

        # Add nodes for each component
        for name, component in self.components.items():
            graph.add_node(name, component.execute)

        # Add edges based on configuration
        edges = self.config.get("edges", [])
        for edge in edges:
            source = edge.get("source")
            target = edge.get("target")
            condition = edge.get("condition")

            if condition:
                # Add conditional edge
                graph.add_conditional_edges(
                    source,
                    self._create_condition_function(condition),
                    {
                        True: target,
                        False: edge.get("fallback", source)
                    }
                )
            else:
                # Add direct edge
                graph.add_edge(source, target)

        # Set entry point
        entry_point = self.config.get("entry_point", next(iter(self.components)))
        graph.set_entry_point(entry_point)

        # Compile the graph
        return graph.compile()

    def _create_condition_function(self, condition_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Create a condition function from configuration."""
        # Implementation for creating conditional functions
        pass

    async def run(self, initial_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run the workflow with the given initial state."""
        # Execute the LangGraph workflow

```

### Step 7.2: Agent System Implementation

from typing import Dict, Any, List
from dataqa.core.component import Component
from dataqa.core.llm import LLMProvider

class Agent:
    """Base class for LLM-powered agents."""

================================================
Design and Architecture Specification for the dataqa Library: A Config-Driven Framework for Natural Language Database InteractionI. IntroductionThis document outlines the technical design and architectural specification for dataqa, a Python library aimed at facilitating natural language querying, analysis, and visualization of data residing in various database systems or accessible via APIs. The primary goal of dataqa is to provide a flexible, modular, and configuration-driven framework that empowers users to build sophisticated data interaction workflows or autonomous agent systems tailored to their specific needs.The core problem addressed is the translation of natural language requests into actionable operations across three key stages: retrieving data (via SQL generation, API calls, or function execution), analyzing the retrieved data (through code generation or predefined functions), and visualizing the results (similarly via code generation or predefined functions).A central challenge in designing such a library is achieving modularity while supporting two distinct operational paradigms: predefined Workflows (orchestrated via code) and dynamic Agents (orchestrated by LLMs). Components must be designed for reuse in both contexts. Furthermore, the library must be extensible to accommodate different agent frameworks (initially LangGraph, with potential future support for CrewAI, Autogen, etc.) without requiring significant refactoring. This necessitates careful abstraction design.Another critical aspect is decoupling the library from direct database access. Instead of managing numerous database connectors, dataqa will interface with an external, user-provided code execution API. This design introduces complexities regarding communication protocols, asynchronous execution, and handling the feedback loop required for iterative code refinement based on execution errors.This specification details the proposed architecture, component design, interface definitions, configuration system, and development standards to address these challenges and guide the implementation of the dataqa library.II. Core Architectural PrinciplesThe design of dataqa is founded on several key software engineering principles to ensure robustness, maintainability, and flexibility.

A. Modularity through Dependency Injection (DI): The library will heavily utilize the Dependency Injection design pattern. DI involves providing dependencies (like configuration objects, LLM clients, or other components) to a class or function from an external source, rather than having the component create them internally.1 This approach promotes loose coupling between components, making the system more modular.3 By decoupling the creation and provision of dependencies, components become easier to test in isolation by injecting mock dependencies.1 Furthermore, DI enhances flexibility, allowing different implementations of a dependency (e.g., different LLM providers, different execution API clients) to be swapped easily, often through configuration changes.3 Python's dynamic nature makes DI implementation straightforward, potentially leveraging frameworks like dependency-injector for managing DI containers and configurations.2 This aligns with the principle of Inversion of Control (IoC), where the control over dependency creation is shifted from the component to an external entity (the container or framework).2


B. Configurability via Pydantic: All aspects of the library's behavior, including LLM selection, component settings, agent/workflow definitions, context sources, and external API details, will be managed through a robust configuration system. Pydantic, specifically its BaseSettings feature, will be employed for defining, validating, and loading configurations.9 Pydantic allows for the creation of clearly defined, type-hinted configuration schemas, enabling static analysis and early detection of misconfigurations.11 It supports loading settings from environment variables, .env files, and default values, providing flexibility in deployment.9 Its validation capabilities ensure that configuration values adhere to expected types and constraints, reducing runtime errors.11 Nested configuration structures can be effectively managed, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the library's settings.10


C. Extensibility via Adapters: To support multiple agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen, etc.) without tightly coupling the core components to any single framework, an Adapter pattern will be implemented. Core functionalities will be encapsulated in generic components. Adapters will then translate the interface of these generic components into the specific format required by each agent framework (e.g., LangGraph nodes, CrewAI tools). This allows the core logic to remain independent, facilitating the addition of support for new frameworks by simply implementing a new adapter.14 This promotes modularity and adheres to the principle of designing for change.


D. Loose Coupling: The combination of DI, configuration-driven design, and the Adapter pattern contributes to overall loose coupling within the system.1 Components have minimal dependencies on the concrete implementations of other components or external systems. The separation of code generation (within dataqa) and code execution (via the external API) is a prime example of loose coupling, isolating the library from the specifics of the user's execution environment. High cohesion within components (grouping related functionality) and low coupling between them are key goals.4

III. Agent/Workflow Abstraction LayerTo enable components to function seamlessly within both predefined workflows and dynamic agent systems, and to facilitate switching between different agent frameworks, a carefully designed abstraction layer is necessary.

A. Rationale: Agent frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and Autogen employ different concepts for defining agents, tools, state, and orchestration.15 LangGraph uses graph-based structures and explicit state management.15 CrewAI focuses on role-based agents collaborating in "crews".15 Autogen emphasizes conversational agents and flexible interaction patterns.15 Pydantic AI offers simpler tool definitions, often used alongside other frameworks.21 A common abstraction is required to allow dataqa components (Querying, Analysis, Visualization) to be used consistently across these diverse paradigms without embedding framework-specific logic within the components themselves.


B. Common Component Interface (DataQAComponent): A base class or interface will define the contract for all core functional components. This interface standardizes how components are executed and how they expose necessary metadata for integration.
Pythonfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Type, Any, Dict

class DataQAComponent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, input_data: BaseModel, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> BaseModel | tuple]:
        """
        Executes the component's logic.
        Accepts validated input data and the current execution state.
        Returns validated output data, and optionally an updated state dictionary.
        """
        pass

    # Optional: Methods for describing the component (for agent tool usage)
    def get_description(self) -> str:
        """Returns a natural language description of what the component does."""
        # Default implementation or abstract method
        return self.__doc__ or self.__class__.__name__

    def get_input_schema(self) -> Type:
        """Returns the Pydantic model defining the expected input structure."""
        # To be implemented by subclasses, potentially introspecting execute signature
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_output_schema(self) -> Type:
        """Returns the Pydantic model defining the output structure."""
        # To be implemented by subclasses
        raise NotImplementedError

This interface ensures that each component has a standardized execution method and can provide metadata (description, input/output schemas) necessary for agent frameworks to use them as tools.


C. Adapter Layer: Specific adapters will bridge the gap between the DataQAComponent interface and the target agent framework.

LangGraph Adapter: This adapter will wrap DataQAComponent instances, making them usable as nodes within a LangGraph graph.14 It will handle the mapping between the component's Pydantic input/output schemas and LangGraph's state dictionary. If a component needs to influence the workflow dynamically, the adapter could potentially emit information used by LangGraph's conditional edges, although primary routing logic often resides in the graph definition itself. LangGraph's strength in managing complex, stateful workflows makes it a suitable initial target.15
Future Adapters (CrewAI, Autogen, Pydantic AI): Subsequent adapters will map DataQAComponent instances to concepts like CrewAI Tools or Tasks 16, Autogen's agent functions or skills 19, or Pydantic AI tools.17 Each adapter must handle the specific integration requirements and data transformations for its respective framework. For instance, a CrewAI adapter might register the component as a tool available to a specific agent role.



D. State Management: The DataQAComponent interface includes a state dictionary in its execute method signature. This allows components to access and potentially modify shared information during execution (e.g., intermediate results, user context). The specific agent framework adapter is responsible for populating this dictionary from the framework's native state mechanism (like LangGraph's graph state 15) before calling execute and updating the framework's state with any modifications returned by the component.


E. Implications of Abstraction: Creating a universal abstraction layer inevitably involves trade-offs. While it enables framework interchangeability and component reuse, it might obscure or prevent the direct use of highly specialized features unique to a particular framework.14 For example, intricate graph manipulation capabilities in LangGraph or specific conversational patterns in Autogen might not map cleanly onto the generic DataQAComponent interface. Attempting to encompass every possible feature would make the abstraction overly complex. Therefore, the abstraction should concentrate on the core execution contract (input, output, state, metadata). Advanced, framework-specific configurations or interactions should be managed outside the core component logic, potentially within the adapter implementation or the workflow/agent definition configured by the user. The primary goal is the reusability of the core Querying, Analysis, and Visualization logic.

IV. Component DesignThe dataqa library will be composed of distinct, reusable components conforming to the DataQAComponent interface.

A. Data Querying Component: This is the most critical component, responsible for translating natural language into executable code to retrieve data.

1. Input: Accepts a natural language query, along with configuration specifying context sources (schema, examples, rules), external execution API details, and LLM settings. Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. NLQ Rewriting: Before generating code or even retrieving context, the initial natural language query may need refinement. This step aims to improve clarity, resolve ambiguities, and format the query for optimal LLM comprehension.22 Simple prompts asking an LLM to rewrite a query often prove insufficient.22 More sophisticated techniques involve providing specific guidance. This could include incorporating predefined Natural Language Rewrite Rules (NLR2s) as textual hints within the prompt 22 or using database-sensitive prompts that leverage schema information or statistics.23 Another approach might involve decomposing complex sentences into simpler, atomic units before processing.28 The specific rewriting strategy should be configurable.
3. Context Retrieval (RAG Strategy): This step employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles to fetch relevant contextual information based on the (potentially rewritten) query. This context is crucial for enabling the LLM to generate accurate, database-specific code.29 The necessary context includes:

Database Schema: Detailed information about tables (names, descriptions), columns (names, descriptions, data types), relationships, and potentially representative sample values.31
Examples: Curated pairs of natural language queries and their corresponding correct code snippets (SQL, API calls, etc.). These serve as few-shot demonstrations for the LLM, guiding it towards the correct syntax and patterns.28 Providing reasoning alongside examples can further enhance understanding.
Business Rules: Textual descriptions of domain-specific logic, constraints, calculations, or terminology relevant to the database schema and query interpretation.34 Including business context has been shown to significantly improve NLQ-to-SQL accuracy.35
The retrieval mechanism typically involves storing embeddings of these context assets (schema descriptions, example queries, rule snippets) in a vector database.29 The incoming natural language query is also embedded, and a similarity search (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)) retrieves the most relevant context chunks.29 Effective chunking strategies are important for large documents or schema descriptions.36 Hybrid search, combining vector similarity with traditional keyword matching, might improve relevance in some cases.36 An alternative, particularly for highly relational schemas, could be graph-based RAG, representing schema elements, rules, and their relationships as nodes and edges in a graph database.29


4. Prompt Composition: The (rewritten) query and the retrieved context (schema, examples, rules) are assembled into a final prompt for the code-generating LLM. This composition process should utilize configurable prompt templates. The prompt must clearly articulate the task (e.g., "Generate a Snowflake SQL query"), provide all necessary context in a structured manner, and specify the desired output format.31 Best practices include:

Representing the database schema clearly, perhaps using standard CREATE TABLE syntax or a simplified structured format.31 Include table and column descriptions.31
Incorporating the most relevant retrieved few-shot examples.28 Studies suggest that selecting examples based on similarity (e.g., using Jaccard similarity) to the input query yields better results than random selection.28
Adding retrieved business rules as explicit instructions or constraints.
Clearly specifying the target code dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL SQL, Python function call syntax).
Using unambiguous instructions and potentially delimiters to structure the prompt.31


5. Code Generation: The composed prompt is sent to the configured LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, specialized models like Code Llama 32). The LLM processes the prompt and generates the corresponding code snippet.
6. Output: The primary output is the generated code snippet. Optionally, the component might also output metadata like the reasoning trace (if provided by the LLM) or a confidence score. Output structured via a Pydantic model.
7. Context vs. Prompt Length Consideration: A critical balance must be struck during context retrieval and prompt composition. Providing comprehensive context (detailed schema, numerous examples, extensive rules) is generally beneficial for accuracy.31 However, LLMs have finite context window limits. Overloading the prompt with excessive or irrelevant information can dilute the focus, increase processing time and cost, and potentially degrade performance.25 Effective RAG requires retrieving only the most pertinent information. This highlights the importance of the retrieval mechanism's precision. Techniques like filtering or re-ranking retrieved results 37 or applying schema relevance filtering 28 might be necessary to ensure only the most valuable context elements are included in the final prompt, dynamically adjusting based on query complexity and context size.



B. Data Analysis Component:

1. Input: Accepts data retrieved by the Querying component (e.g., in a structured format like a list of dictionaries or potentially a pandas DataFrame if standardized) and an analysis instruction (either natural language or a predefined function identifier). Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. Functionality: Provides two modes of operation:

Code Generation: Generates analysis code (e.g., Python code using libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy) based on a natural language request. This requires the LLM to understand the structure of the input data.
Pre-built Functions: Executes predefined, reusable analysis functions (e.g., calculating summary statistics, performing time-series decomposition, applying specific data transformations) selected via configuration or inferred from the natural language request.


3. Interface: Conforms to the DataQAComponent interface, accepting data and analysis instructions, returning processed data or analysis results.
4. Output: Analysis results, which could be transformed data, statistical summaries, textual interpretations, or other derived information. Output structured via a Pydantic model.



C. Data Visualization Component:

1. Input: Accepts data (typically from the Querying or Analysis step) and a visualization instruction (natural language or predefined function ID). Input structured via a Pydantic model.
2. Functionality: Similar to the Analysis component, offers two modes:

Code Generation: Generates visualization code (e.g., using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or other plotting libraries) based on a natural language request and the input data structure.
Pre-built Functions: Executes predefined plotting functions (e.g., generate a standard bar chart, line plot, scatter matrix) selected via configuration or inferred from the request.


3. Interface: Conforms to the DataQAComponent interface, accepting data and visualization instructions.
4. Output: A visualization artifact. This could be a plot object from a library, image data (e.g., PNG bytes), or a structured representation like a JSON specification for a JavaScript charting library (e.g., Vega-Lite). Output structured via a Pydantic model.



D. Component Reusability (Agents vs. Workflows): The design explicitly supports using these components in both orchestration modes.

Workflows: In a predefined workflow (likely configured as a sequence or graph), the orchestration logic directly invokes the execute method of the configured components in the specified order, passing data and state between them.
Agents: In an agent-based system, an LLM-powered agent (like the Supervisor agent detailed later) utilizes the metadata provided by the DataQAComponent interface (get_description, get_input_schema, get_output_schema). The agent uses this information to understand what each component (now acting as a "tool") does and decides which tool to invoke next. The framework's adapter layer handles the actual invocation of the component's execute method based on the agent's decision.


V. External Code Execution API InterfaceA crucial design decision is to decouple dataqa from the actual execution of generated code. This is achieved by defining a clear interface for an external API that users must provide. dataqa generates code (SQL, Python) and sends it to this API; the API executes it in the user's environment and returns the results or errors.

A. Purpose: This interface acts as a contract 39 between dataqa and the user's data infrastructure. It allows dataqa to remain agnostic to specific databases, connection methods, authentication mechanisms, or execution environments. Users implement an API endpoint conforming to this specification, which handles the interaction with their specific data sources (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, internal function registry).


B. Communication Pattern: Given that database queries or data processing code can potentially run for extended periods, and the need for an iterative refinement loop based on execution feedback, an asynchronous communication pattern is strongly recommended over a simple synchronous REST API. Synchronous calls can lead to timeouts 40 and make handling long-running tasks difficult. Asynchronous patterns better support non-blocking operations and feedback mechanisms.41

**Recommendation:** An asynchronous REST API utilizing HTTP `202 Accepted` responses [42] is the recommended approach. The initial request submits the code for execution and receives a job ID. `dataqa` then polls a status endpoint using this ID to retrieve the final results or error information. This pattern effectively handles long-running tasks and provides a clear mechanism for retrieving outcomes.


C. Interface Specification (Asynchronous REST Example):

1. Submit Job Endpoint (POST /execute):

Request Body: A JSON object containing the code to execute, its type, and any necessary context.
JSON{
  "code_type": "sql" | "python_func" | "python_api",
  "code": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE country = 'US';",
  "context": {
    "session_id": "user123_session",
    "required_libraries": ["pandas"]
  }
}


Response (Success): 202 Accepted. The response body includes a unique identifier for the submitted job.
JSON{ "job_id": "abc-123-xyz-789" }


Response (Error): Standard HTTP errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request for invalid input, 500 Internal Server Error for execution environment issues).


2. Get Job Status/Result Endpoint (GET /status/{job_id}):

Path Parameter: job_id obtained from the /execute response.
Response (Pending/Running): Indicates the job is still processing. Progress information is optional.
JSON{ "status": "pending" }
// or
{ "status": "running", "progress": 0.5 }


Response (Success): Indicates successful execution. Includes the results (format depends on code_type, e.g., list of dictionaries for SQL) and any relevant logs.
JSON{
  "status": "success",
  "results":,
  "logs": ["Query executed successfully."]
}


Response (Error): Indicates execution failed. Includes a structured error message, error type (e.g., SyntaxError, RuntimeError, PermissionError), and logs.
JSON{
  "status": "error",
  "error_message": "Table 'users_typo' not found",
  "error_type": "DatabaseError",
  "logs": ["Execution failed at line 1..."]
}


Response (Not Found): 404 Not Found if the job_id is invalid.





D. Data Formats: JSON should be used for all request and response bodies. Clear schemas should be defined (ideally using Pydantic models that can be shared as part of dataqa's documentation or helper utilities) to ensure consistency.


E. Error Handling & Feedback Loop: The ability to handle errors and refine code is critical. The external API must return detailed, structured error information.43 When dataqa receives an error status from the /status/{job_id} endpoint, the Data Querying component (or a dedicated error-handling module/agent) needs to:

Parse the error_message and error_type.
Attempt to diagnose the issue (e.g., syntax error in generated code, runtime error like invalid table name, permission issue).
Formulate a correction strategy. This might involve modifying the original NLQ, adjusting prompt parameters, or directly instructing the LLM to fix the generated code based on the error message. This mirrors counterexample-guided refinement techniques seen in query rewriting 22 and iterative code refinement based on execution feedback.44
Generate corrected code using the LLM.
Resubmit the corrected code via the /execute endpoint.
This iterative loop continues until execution succeeds or a retry limit is reached.



F. Security: While the implementation of the API server resides in the user's environment, dataqa should provide guidance on security best practices, such as using HTTPS, implementing proper authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens passed via configuration), and performing input validation on the server side.39 dataqa needs secure mechanisms (like Pydantic's SecretStr and environment variable loading) to handle credentials required to authenticate with the user's API endpoint.10


G. API Contract Flexibility Consideration: Defining a rigid API specification ensures predictability for dataqa.39 However, users might possess pre-existing internal systems for code execution that don't match this exact contract. Forcing users to build a specific adapter API could be a barrier to adoption. An alternative or supplementary approach is to define a Python adapter interface within dataqa. Users could implement this interface (a Python class with methods like submit_job and get_status) directly in their environment. dataqa could then be configured to use this Python adapter instead of the default REST API client, allowing direct calls to the user's execution logic without requiring a network hop or a specific API structure. This aligns well with the Dependency Injection principle, offering greater flexibility.

VI. Multi-Agent System OrchestrationFor scenarios requiring dynamic decision-making and coordination between the core functionalities (Querying, Analysis, Visualization), a multi-agent system architecture is appropriate.

A. Architecture Choice: A Hierarchical Supervisor pattern is recommended.14 In this pattern, a central Supervisor agent coordinates the activities of specialized subordinate agents. This structure aligns well with the sequential nature of the overall task (Query → Analyze → Visualize) and provides centralized control over the workflow, state management, and task delegation. Compared to a fully networked architecture where any agent can talk to any other, the supervisor model offers simpler control flow and communication management for this problem domain.14


B. Agent Roles:

1. Supervisor Agent: Acts as the orchestrator.

Responsibilities: Receives the initial user request (natural language query and overall goal). Decomposes the high-level task into logical steps (e.g., "First, query the data for X," "Next, analyze the results to find Y," "Finally, visualize Z").46 Manages the overall state, including intermediate data results and conversation history. Determines which specialized agent to invoke for each step based on the current state and task decomposition.46 Receives outputs from specialized agents, potentially asking for clarification or deciding the next step. Compiles the final response or visualization for the user.46
Implementation: Likely implemented as an LLM equipped with "tools" representing the specialized agents. The LLM uses its reasoning capabilities to plan and delegate [14 (tool-calling supervisor)].


2. Data Querying Agent: Focuses exclusively on data retrieval.

Responsibilities: Receives a specific query task (in natural language) from the Supervisor. Executes the full Data Querying component logic (Section IV.A): NLQ rewriting, RAG context retrieval, prompt composition, LLM code generation. Interacts with the External Code Execution API via the defined interface (Section V) to run the generated code. Manages the error handling and iterative refinement loop for code execution errors. Returns the structured data results (or an error state) back to the Supervisor.
Implementation: This agent encapsulates the complex logic of the Data Querying component. It might internally use an LLM (e.g., ReAct style) or be implemented as a more deterministic workflow (potentially a LangGraph subgraph itself) exposed as a single tool to the Supervisor.


3. Data Analysis Agent: Focuses on data analysis tasks.

Responsibilities: Receives data (from the Querying Agent via the Supervisor) and analysis instructions (either natural language or a structured request) from the Supervisor. Executes the Data Analysis component logic (Section IV.B), either generating analysis code (potentially interacting with the Execution API if needed) or running pre-built analysis functions. Returns the analysis results (transformed data, summaries, insights) to the Supervisor.


4. Data Visualization Agent: Focuses on creating visualizations.

Responsibilities: Receives data (from Querying or Analysis via the Supervisor) and visualization instructions from the Supervisor. Executes the Data Visualization component logic (Section IV.C), generating visualization code (potentially using the Execution API) or running pre-built plotting functions. Returns the visualization artifact (image, plot object, JSON spec) to the Supervisor.





C. Communication & State: Communication flows primarily through the Supervisor.14 Specialized agents generally do not communicate directly with each other. The Supervisor maintains the central state (e.g., original query, intermediate data, analysis results, visualization specs) and passes relevant parts of the state to specialized agents when delegating tasks. Agent frameworks like LangGraph provide robust mechanisms for managing such state transitions within a graph structure, making them well-suited for implementing this pattern.15 Clear data schemas (using Pydantic models) should define the structure of information exchanged between the Supervisor and the specialized agents.


D. Workflow Definition: While the agent system is dynamic, the high-level flow (Query → Analyze → Visualize) can often be guided by configuration or initial instructions provided to the Supervisor. The system allows for flexibility; for example, the Supervisor might decide to loop back to the Querying agent if analysis reveals insufficient data, or skip Visualization if the user only asked for analysis.


E. Agent Granularity Consideration: The term "agent" in this hierarchical structure refers to a functional role. The implementation of a specialized agent, like the Data Querying Agent, might itself be quite complex. It doesn't necessarily correspond to a single LLM call. Instead, it could encapsulate an entire multi-step workflow or even a LangGraph subgraph that performs the detailed steps of rewriting, retrieval, generation, execution, and refinement. The Supervisor interacts with this functional unit through the standardized tool interface provided by the adapter layer. This allows for modularity at the top level (Supervisor managing Query/Analyze/Viz roles) while accommodating significant complexity within each role's implementation. This approach leverages the strengths of multi-agent systems for task decomposition 14 while allowing robust implementation of complex sub-tasks. Visualization tools for agent interactions can be valuable for debugging and understanding these complex flows.46

VII. Configuration System DesignA flexible and robust configuration system is essential for managing the various aspects of the dataqa library.

A. Technology Choice: Pydantic's BaseSettings class is the recommended technology.9 Pydantic provides a powerful framework for defining configuration schemas using standard Python type hints. This enables static analysis, editor autocompletion, and, crucially, runtime validation of configuration values.11 It ensures that configurations conform to the expected structure and data types, catching errors early in the application lifecycle.12 Pydantic's widespread adoption, particularly in frameworks like FastAPI 11, makes it a familiar choice for many Python developers. It offers superior validation capabilities compared to plain dictionaries or standard dataclasses.51


B. Structure: A hierarchical structure using nested Pydantic models is appropriate for organizing the configuration logically.


A top-level DataQAConfig model will serve as the main entry point.


Nested models will encapsulate settings for specific areas:

LLMSettings: Provider (e.g., 'openai', 'anthropic', 'bedrock'), model name, API keys (using SecretStr), temperature, etc.
ExecutionAPISettings: Type ('async_rest', 'sync_rest', 'direct_python'), relevant URLs (submit, status template), authentication tokens (using SecretStr).
RAGSourceSettings: Configuration for context retrieval, potentially a list allowing multiple sources. Each source might specify its type ('vector_db', 'file_system', 'graph_db'), connection details, and pointers to schema, examples, and business rule data.
ComponentsConfig: Nested models for each core component (QueryingComponentSettings, AnalysisComponentSettings, VisualizationComponentSettings) containing component-specific parameters (e.g., rewriter toggle, prompt template paths, default analysis functions).
WorkflowDefinitions: Structures defining predefined workflows (sequences or graphs of component executions).
AgentDefinitions: Configuration for agent-based systems, including supervisor settings and specialized agent configurations.



Conceptual Example:
Pythonfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, SecretStr
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

class LLMSettings(BaseModel):
    provider: str = 'openai'
    model: str = 'gpt-4-turbo'
    api_key: Optional = None
    temperature: float = 0.1

class ExecutionAPISettings(BaseModel):
    type: str = Field('async_rest', description="Type of execution API interface")
    submit_url: Optional[str] = None
    status_url_template: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="URL template for status, e.g., /api/status/{job_id}")
    auth_token: Optional = None

class RAGSourceSettings(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: str # e.g., 'vector_db_chroma', 'local_files'
    connection_details: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    schema_source: str # Path or identifier
    examples_source: str # Path or identifier
    rules_source: str # Path or identifier

class QueryingComponentSettings(BaseModel):
    rewriter_enabled: bool = True
    retriever_type: str = 'vector_similarity'
    prompt_template_path: str = "prompts/default_query_prompt.txt"
    max_refinement_attempts: int = 3

#... Define AnalysisComponentSettings, VisualizationComponentSettings

#... Define WorkflowDefinition, AgentDefinition models

class DataQAConfig(BaseSettings):
    llm: LLMSettings = LLMSettings()
    execution_api: ExecutionAPISettings
    rag_sources: List =
    querying_component: QueryingComponentSettings = QueryingComponentSettings()
    # analysis_component: AnalysisComponentSettings =...
    # visualization_component: VisualizationComponentSettings =...
    # workflows: Dict[str, WorkflowDefinition] = {}
    # agents: Dict[str, AgentDefinition] = {}

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_prefix='DATAQA_', # Environment variables start with DATAQA_
        env_file='.env',     # Load from.env file
        env_nested_delimiter='__', # Allow DATAQA_LLM__MODEL env var
        secrets_dir=None, # Optional directory for secret files
        validate_assignment=True # Validate fields on assignment
    )





C. Loading Mechanisms: Pydantic BaseSettings inherently supports a prioritized loading order:

Arguments passed during model initialization.
Environment variables (respecting env_prefix and env_nested_delimiter).9
Variables loaded from a .env file specified by env_file.9
Variables loaded from secret files in secrets_dir.10
Default values defined in the Pydantic model fields.
This provides flexibility for development (using .env or defaults) and deployment (using environment variables or secrets). While tools like Hydra offer more advanced composition and command-line overrides 12, Pydantic's built-in capabilities are often sufficient and simpler to manage for library configuration.



D. Validation: Pydantic automatically performs type validation upon loading the configuration.9 Custom validators can be added to enforce more complex rules or cross-field dependencies if required. This ensures configuration integrity before the library components attempt to use the settings.11


E. Secrets Management: Sensitive information like API keys or authentication tokens should be handled using Pydantic's SecretStr type.10 This type prevents accidental exposure in logs or tracebacks. Values for SecretStr fields should be loaded securely from environment variables or dedicated secret files (e.g., Docker secrets mounted into a directory specified by secrets_dir) 10, never hardcoded in configuration files.1


F. Configuration Complexity Consideration: While comprehensive configuration is powerful, overly complex schemas with deep nesting or excessive options can become difficult for users to understand and manage.51 This can lead to "YAML/config engineering" 12 where determining the effective configuration requires tracing multiple overrides and defaults. The design should prioritize clarity by providing sensible defaults for most options, using logical nesting without excessive depth, and offering clear documentation for all settings and their loading precedence. Pydantic's validation errors should also be informative to help users correct misconfigurations quickly. The goal is a balance between flexibility and usability.

VIII. Development Standards & Project StructureAdhering to standard Python development practices and maintaining a well-organized project structure are crucial for collaboration, maintainability, and usability.

A. Dependency Management: Poetry will be used for dependency management and packaging.4 All project metadata, dependencies (core and development), and tool configurations will reside in the pyproject.toml file.54 Core library dependencies will be listed under [tool.poetry.dependencies], while development tools (like pytest, sphinx, ruff) will be in a dedicated group, e.g., [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies].54 The poetry.lock file, which ensures deterministic builds by locking dependency versions, will be committed to version control.52


B. Code Formatting & Linting: Ruff is mandated for both code formatting and linting, providing a fast and unified toolchain.54 Ruff's configuration will be managed within pyproject.toml under [tool.ruff], [tool.ruff.lint], and [tool.ruff.format] sections.54 Standard rulesets like bugbear, isort (for import sorting), and pyupgrade should be enabled.59 To enforce code style consistency, pre-commit hooks will be configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml to automatically run Ruff before commits.58


C. Testing: Pytest is the chosen framework for writing and running unit, integration, and functional tests.4 Tests will be located in the tests/ directory at the project root.59 Pytest fixtures should be used for managing test setup and teardown efficiently. Given the reliance on external services (LLMs, Execution API) and internal components interacting via Dependency Injection, mocking will be essential. Libraries like unittest.mock or pytest-mock should be used extensively to isolate components during testing, allowing verification of interactions without making actual external calls.2 High test coverage should be a target metric.


D. Documentation: Sphinx will be used for generating project documentation.52 Documentation source files (using reStructuredText or Markdown via MyST) will reside in the docs/ directory.59 Sphinx should be configured to automatically generate API reference documentation from docstrings within the source code. A consistent docstring style (e.g., Google or NumPy, supported by the Sphinx napoleon extension) should be adopted.52 The documentation must include:

Installation instructions.
A Quick Start guide.
Tutorials demonstrating common use cases (building workflows, configuring agents).
A comprehensive configuration reference detailing all options in the Pydantic models.
Detailed specification of the External Code Execution API contract.
API reference for library classes and functions.
Guidelines for developers wishing to contribute.
Documentation should be hosted publicly, for example, on ReadTheDocs 59, with build configurations managed either in pyproject.toml or a .readthedocs.yaml file.59



E. Project Layout: A standard Python project structure employing the src/ layout is recommended for clarity and to avoid potential import issues.56

F. README File: The README.md file serves as the primary entry point for users and developers.55 It must contain:

User Section: Project description, key features, installation instructions (poetry add dataqa), a concise quick start example demonstrating both workflow and agent usage, and prominent links to the full documentation.
Developer Section: Instructions for setting up the development environment (poetry install --with dev), running tests (pytest), building documentation (sphinx-build), contribution guidelines, and a brief architectural overview.



G. Versioning: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) will be strictly followed to communicate the nature of changes between releases.45 Version management can be automated using tools like setuptools-scm 54 or poetry-dynamic-versioning (if compatible with the chosen build backend) to derive the version from Git tags, or managed manually through Poetry and updated as part of the release process.


H. Continuous Integration (CI): A CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions 59) should be established to automate quality checks. The CI workflow must:

Run Ruff for linting and format checking.
Execute the Pytest suite, preferably across multiple supported Python versions using a matrix strategy or a tool like tox.
Build the Sphinx documentation to catch errors.
Optionally, automate the process of building the package and publishing it to PyPI or a private repository upon creation of release tags.60


IX. Conclusions & RecommendationsThe dataqa library presents a powerful approach to bridging the gap between natural language and structured data operations. Its success hinges on a modular, configurable, and extensible architecture.Conclusions:
Modularity is Key: Dependency Injection and a clear component interface (DataQAComponent) are fundamental to achieving the required modularity and enabling reuse across workflow and agent paradigms.
Abstraction Enables Flexibility: An adapter layer is essential for supporting multiple agent frameworks without tightly coupling core logic, though it requires careful design to balance generality and framework-specific power.
RAG is Crucial for Querying: The Data Querying component's accuracy heavily relies on effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide necessary context (schema, examples, rules) to the code-generating LLM. The quality of retrieval directly impacts the quality of generated code.
Decoupled Execution is Necessary: The External Code Execution API provides vital decoupling but necessitates an asynchronous communication pattern (like Async REST with polling) to handle potentially long-running tasks and the critical error-feedback loop for code refinement.
Hierarchical Agents Fit the Task: A supervised multi-agent architecture provides a suitable structure for orchestrating the query, analysis, and visualization steps, leveraging specialized agents for each function.
Configuration Management Needs Structure: Pydantic BaseSettings offers the best combination of type safety, validation, and flexible loading mechanisms for managing the library's configuration.
Standard Practices Ensure Quality: Adherence to established Python development standards (Poetry, Ruff, Pytest, Sphinx, CI) is non-negotiable for building a maintainable and reliable library.
Recommendations & Next Steps:
Prioritize Core Functionality: Initial development efforts should concentrate on the Data Querying component and the External Code Execution API interface and client-side logic. These are the most complex and foundational pieces. Implement the LangGraph adapter first to provide immediate agent framework support.
Phased Feature Rollout: Begin by implementing support for predefined Workflows, as they offer a more controlled environment. Subsequently, add support for dynamic Agent systems using the Supervisor pattern. Within components, focus on the core code generation capabilities before adding extensive libraries of pre-built analysis or visualization functions. Similarly, start with basic RAG (e.g., vector similarity on schema/examples) before exploring more advanced techniques like hybrid search or graph RAG.
Finalize API Contract: Solidify the asynchronous External Code Execution API specification early in the development process. Provide clear documentation and potentially a simple reference server implementation to guide users who need to build the corresponding backend for their environment. Seriously consider offering the alternative Python adapter interface (Insight 5) for users who prefer direct integration over a network API.
Invest Heavily in Testing: Rigorous testing is paramount, especially integration tests covering the end-to-end flow of the Data Querying component: NLQ -> RAG -> Prompting -> LLM -> Code -> Execution API -> Error Handling -> Refinement -> Execution API -> Result. Mocking the LLM and Execution API effectively will be critical.
Continuous Documentation: Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation throughout the development lifecycle. Pay special attention to documenting the configuration options and the External Code Execution API contract, as these are key user-facing aspects.
By following this specification and prioritizing these recommendations, the dataqa library can be developed into a robust, flexible, and powerful tool for natural language interaction with data.


======================================
LLM Response - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Version 1
=====================================
Okay, here is a detailed prompt designed to guide an LLM in generating the `dataqa` Python library based on your requirements. This prompt aims to be comprehensive, covering architecture, components, extensibility, configuration, specific functionalities, and development standards.

```prompt
**Objective:** Generate the complete source code for a Python library named `dataqa`. This library provides a configurable framework for natural language querying, analysis, and visualization of data, interacting with user-provided data execution endpoints.

**Core Problem:** Enable users to ask questions in natural language about their data and receive answers, potentially including analysis and visualizations. The library should orchestrate the process, translating NL questions into executable code (e.g., SQL, Python), executing it via a user-defined API, and processing the results.

**Key Design Principles:**

1.  **Configuration-Driven:** All aspects (workflows, agents, components, LLM settings, API endpoints, data assets) should be configurable, likely via YAML files parsed into Pydantic models.
2.  **Modularity:** Build the library around reusable `Components` that perform specific tasks (e.g., question rewriting, code generation, data execution).
3.  **Extensibility (Agent Frameworks):** Design the agent orchestration layer with abstraction. While initially implementing support for LangGraph, ensure the architecture allows adding support for other frameworks (CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic AI) with minimal changes to the core library logic. Avoid tight coupling with LangGraph.
4.  **Framework Agnostic Data Execution:** The library will *not* include database connectors. It will generate code (SQL, Python for analysis/viz) and send it to a user-provided "Data API" for execution.
5.  **Support for Workflows and Agents:**
    * **Workflows:** Allow users to define fixed, predefined graphs of components (using LangGraph initially) via configuration. Suitable for repeatable, structured tasks.
    * **Agents:** Allow users to configure LLM-powered agents that dynamically decide which components (tools) to use and in what order. Suitable for more complex, exploratory tasks. Implement a multi-agent approach (Coordinator -> specialized agents).

**High-Level Architecture:**

1.  **Configuration Loader:** Parses user-defined YAML configuration files into Pydantic models.
2.  **Core Components:** A collection of classes, each responsible for a specific step in the NLQ process. These should be designed to be usable independently, within a workflow graph, or as tools for an agent.
3.  **Workflow Orchestrator:** Takes a workflow configuration and executes the defined graph of components (initially using LangGraph).
4.  **Agent Orchestrator:** Manages the lifecycle and execution of agents.
    * **Agent Framework Adapter Interface:** Define a standard interface (`AgentAdapter`) that abstracts the specifics of the underlying agent framework (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI).
    * **LangGraph Adapter Implementation:** The initial implementation of the `AgentAdapter` using LangGraph.
    * **Agent Definitions:** Configuration specifies agent types (e.g., Coordinator, DataQueryAgent, DataAnalysisAgent, DataVisualizationAgent), their LLMs, prompts, and available tools (which map to Core Components).
5.  **Data API Client:** A component responsible for interacting with the user-provided external API endpoint for code execution.

**Core Components (Implement as Python classes):**

1.  **`QuestionRewriter`:**
    * Input: Original user question, conversation history (optional).
    * Function: Rewrites the question for clarity, resolves ambiguity, incorporates context. Uses an LLM.
    * Output: Rewritten question.
2.  **`AssetRetriever`:**
    * Input: Rewritten question, configuration pointing to asset sources.
    * Function: Retrieves relevant assets needed for code generation based on the question's context. Assets include:
        * Database Schema (table/column names, descriptions, types, sample values).
        * Examples (NL question -> Code pairs, optional reasoning).
        * Business Rules/Glossary.
        * (Consider using a vector store for efficient retrieval based on semantic similarity).
    * Output: Subset of relevant schema, examples, and rules.
3.  **`PromptComposer`:**
    * Input: Rewritten question, retrieved assets, task type (query, analysis, viz), configured prompt templates.
    * Function: Constructs the final prompt to be sent to the LLM for code generation, incorporating context, schema, examples, rules, and specific instructions.
    * Output: Formatted prompt string.
4.  **`CodeGenerator`:**
    * Input: Composed prompt, target language (e.g., 'sql', 'python'), LLM configuration.
    * Function: Sends the prompt to the configured LLM and parses the generated code from the response. Includes basic validation/cleaning if possible.
    * Output: String containing the generated code.
5.  **`DataAPIExecutor`:**
    * Input: Generated code string, configured Data API endpoint details (URL, auth method/token).
    * Function: Sends the code to the user's external Data API for execution. Handles the request/response cycle.
    * Output: Execution result (e.g., data payload, success/failure status, error message, logs).
    * **Error Handling:** Must robustly handle API connection errors and capture execution errors returned by the user's API (e.g., SQL syntax errors, Python exceptions). The error details must be propagated back clearly.
6.  **`AnalysisExecutor`:** (Could potentially generate Python code executed via `DataAPIExecutor` or run predefined analysis functions)
    * Input: Data (from `DataAPIExecutor`), analysis request (derived from NL query or workflow step).
    * Function: Performs data analysis (e.g., aggregations, statistics). Might involve generating Python/pandas code or calling pre-built functions.
    * Output: Analysis results (text summary, structured data).
7.  **`VisualizationGenerator`:** (Could potentially generate Python code executed via `DataAPIExecutor` or use pre-built viz functions)
    * Input: Data, visualization request.
    * Function: Generates data visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs). Might involve generating Python code (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) or calling pre-built functions.
    * Output: Visualization data (e.g., image file path/bytes, JSON spec for a charting library).

**Data API Interaction and Error Handling:**

1.  **API Contract:** Define a clear, recommended contract for the user's Data API. `dataqa` will act as a client.
    * *Request:* Should accept `{ "code": "...", "language": "sql|python", "session_id": "..." (optional) }`.
    * *Response:* Should return `{ "success": boolean, "data": list_of_dicts | string | null, "error": string | null, "logs": string | null }`.
2.  **`DataAPIExecutor` Implementation:**
    * Use a standard HTTP library (like `requests`).
    * Send the code according to the configured endpoint and method.
    * Include necessary authentication headers/tokens from config.
    * Handle HTTP errors (timeouts, connection errors, 4xx/5xx status codes).
    * Parse the response. If `success` is false, extract the `error` message.
3.  **Retry/Correction Loop:**
    * **In Workflows:** Error handling can be explicitly defined in the LangGraph graph (e.g., conditional edges based on the `DataAPIExecutor` output). A simple retry might be possible, but complex correction is harder.
    * **In Agents:** This is where error handling shines.
        * The `DataAPIExecutor` tool, when it fails (either HTTP error or `success: false`), should return the error details clearly to the agent.
        * The agent's LLM, prompted appropriately (e.g., "The previous attempt failed with this error: [...]. Analyze the error and decide the next step: retry, modify the code, or ask the user for clarification."), can then choose to:
            * Call `CodeGenerator` again with the original prompt plus the error context to attempt a fix.
            * Retry the `DataAPIExecutor` if it was a transient network issue.
            * Inform the user/coordinator that it cannot proceed.
    * **MCP vs API:** A standard RESTful API (potentially stateful using session IDs if needed by the *user's* backend) is simpler to implement and integrate initially than MCP. Stick to the API client approach within `dataqa`. The library doesn't need its own server component.

**Extensibility for Agent Frameworks:**

1.  **`AgentAdapter` Interface:** Define a Python abstract base class or Protocol:
    ```python
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
    from typing import List, Dict, Any

    class AgentAdapter(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def initialize_agent(self, agent_config: Dict[str, Any], tools: List[Any]) -> Any: # Returns framework-specific agent object
            pass

        @abstractmethod
        def run_agent(self, agent_instance: Any, user_input: str) -> Any: # Returns final result
            pass

        # Potentially other methods for state management, tool registration etc.
    ```
2.  **`LangGraphAdapter`:** Implement the `AgentAdapter` interface using LangGraph functions/classes. It will translate the generic agent configuration into LangGraph-specific setup (StateGraph, nodes, edges, tool invocation).
3.  **`AgentOrchestrator`:** Uses the configured adapter (loaded dynamically based on config) to initialize and run agents. The core logic interacts only with the `AgentAdapter` interface methods.
4.  **Adding New Frameworks:** To add CrewAI, implement a `CrewAIAdapter` class conforming to the `AgentAdapter` interface, translating the configuration into CrewAI concepts (Agents, Tasks, Tools, Crew). Update config options to allow selecting `framework: crewai`.

**Development Standards:**

* **Environment Management:** Use Poetry. Generate `pyproject.toml` with dependencies (e.g., `langgraph`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `requests`, `openai`/`google-generativeai`, etc.).
* **Testing:** Use `pytest`. Include unit tests for components, configuration loading, and adapter logic (can mock external calls like LLMs and Data API). Aim for good test coverage.
* **Documentation:** Use Sphinx for generating documentation. Docstrings should follow Sphinx style (reStructuredText). Include:
    * API Reference (auto-generated from docstrings).
    * Tutorials (how to configure and run simple workflows/agents).
    * Configuration Guide (explaining all YAML options).
    * Developer Guide (how to add new components, agent adapters).
* **Formatting/Linting:** Use `ruff` for formatting and linting. Configure `ruff` in `pyproject.toml`.
* **README.md:** Create a comprehensive README including:
    * Project overview and goals.
    * Installation instructions (using Poetry).
    * **Quick Start / Usage Guide:** Simple examples of defining and running a workflow and an agent using configuration.
    * **Configuration:** Link to detailed config docs.
    * **Developer Guide:** How to contribute, run tests, build docs. Project structure overview. How to add components/adapters.
    * **Data API Contract:** Clearly specify the expected interface for the user's data execution endpoint.
    * License (e.g., Apache 2.0 or MIT).
