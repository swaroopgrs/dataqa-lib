# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration system builds upon the foundational DataQA MVP to provide sophisticated multi-agent workflows with hierarchical management, dynamic planning, and domain-specific intelligence. This system enables complex data analysis tasks through coordinated agent collaboration, adaptive planning strategies, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks. The system will support enterprise-grade scenarios requiring human oversight, domain expertise integration, and robust performance monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to configure hierarchical agent relationships through YAML definitions, so that I can create complex multi-agent workflows with clear delegation patterns and responsibility boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a system architect defines agent hierarchies in YAML THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the hierarchical relationships using Pydantic models
2. WHEN the configuration includes manager-worker relationships THEN the system SHALL establish proper delegation chains and communication protocols
3. WHEN agent roles and capabilities are specified THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based task assignment and execution boundaries
4. IF the hierarchical configuration contains circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect and report configuration errors with clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want agents to dynamically adapt their execution plans based on intermediate results, so that complex analysis workflows can self-correct and optimize without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent executes a plan step THEN the system SHALL evaluate the results against success criteria and continuation conditions
2. WHEN intermediate results indicate plan adjustment is needed THEN the system SHALL trigger replanning with context from previous steps
3. WHEN replanning occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve successful intermediate results and avoid redundant work
4. WHEN maximum replanning iterations are reached THEN the system SHALL escalate to human oversight or terminate gracefully with diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want to inject business rules and domain knowledge into agent workflows, so that generated solutions align with industry standards and organizational policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain knowledge is configured THEN the system SHALL load and index business rules, schemas, and domain-specific constraints
2. WHEN agents generate plans or code THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant domain knowledge into decision-making processes
3. WHEN domain rules conflict with user requests THEN the system SHALL prioritize compliance and explain constraints to users
4. WHEN domain knowledge is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh agent capabilities without requiring system restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation capabilities, so that I can measure agent performance, identify improvement areas, and ensure consistent quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark suites are executed THEN the system SHALL run agents against standardized test cases and collect performance metrics
2. WHEN LLM judges evaluate responses THEN the system SHALL provide structured scoring with reasoning and confidence measures
3. WHEN performance trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate reports comparing agent configurations and identifying optimization opportunities
4. WHEN quality thresholds are not met THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and provide diagnostic information for remediation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want human-in-the-loop approval workflows for sensitive operations, so that critical decisions maintain human oversight while benefiting from agent assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents identify sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL pause execution and request human approval with context and risk assessment
2. WHEN approval requests are presented THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of proposed actions and potential impacts
3. WHEN humans provide feedback or modifications THEN the system SHALL incorporate guidance into ongoing execution and future similar scenarios
4. WHEN approval timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with configurable fallback behaviors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want advanced monitoring and observability features, so that I can track agent performance, diagnose issues, and optimize system resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute workflows THEN the system SHALL collect detailed telemetry including execution times, resource usage, and decision points
2. WHEN errors or performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with correlation IDs and diagnostic context
3. WHEN system health is monitored THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for agent utilization, success rates, and resource consumption
4. WHEN performance bottlenecks are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for configuration optimization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible agent capability frameworks, so that I can create specialized agents for new domains without modifying core orchestration logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new agent types are developed THEN the system SHALL support plugin-based registration with capability declarations
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL provide standardized message protocols and state management interfaces
3. WHEN agent capabilities are extended THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
4. WHEN custom tools are integrated THEN the system SHALL provide secure execution environments with proper isolation and resource limits
