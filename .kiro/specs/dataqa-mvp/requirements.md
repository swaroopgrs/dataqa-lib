# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DataQA MVP is a foundational implementation of the composable data agent framework that enables natural language interaction with structured data. This MVP focuses on core functionality including intelligent grounding through RAG, secure execution environments, and basic agentic capabilities. The system will provide a Python framework that allows developers to build data agents that can query databases, perform analysis, and generate visualizations through natural language interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure data agents through YAML files, so that I can quickly set up and customize agents without writing complex code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides a YAML configuration file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the configuration using Pydantic models
2. WHEN the configuration includes database connections THEN the system SHALL establish secure connections to specified data sources
3. WHEN the configuration includes LLM settings THEN the system SHALL initialize the specified language model with provided parameters
4. IF the configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to ask questions about my data in natural language, so that I can get insights without writing SQL or Python code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate SQL or Python code to answer the question
2. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL use relevant database schema and business context from the knowledge base
3. WHEN the generated code is ready THEN the system SHALL execute it in a secure, sandboxed environment
4. WHEN execution completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return results in a user-friendly format
5. IF the query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want data agents to operate within secure execution boundaries, so that I can ensure enterprise security and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated by the LLM THEN the system SHALL execute it in an isolated environment separate from the generation process
2. WHEN accessing databases THEN the system SHALL use configured connection parameters and respect access controls
3. WHEN handling sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL require explicit user approval before execution
4. WHEN errors occur during execution THEN the system SHALL provide safe error messages without exposing system internals

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance agent accuracy with domain-specific knowledge, so that generated code aligns with business rules and database schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the system THEN the system SHALL ingest and index provided knowledge documents
2. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context from the knowledge base
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL incorporate retrieved context into LLM prompts
4. WHEN updating knowledge THEN the system SHALL support adding new documents and refreshing the knowledge base

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to generate visualizations from my data, so that I can better understand patterns and communicate insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a chart or plot THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate visualization code using matplotlib/seaborn
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL return plots as image data that can be displayed or saved
3. WHEN visualization parameters are not specified THEN the system SHALL choose appropriate defaults based on data characteristics
4. IF the data is not suitable for the requested visualization THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative chart types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the framework through both programmatic APIs and CLI tools, so that I can integrate it into different workflows and deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Python API THEN developers SHALL be able to create and configure agents programmatically
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN users SHALL be able to run agents and process queries from the command line
3. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL provide CLI tools to evaluate agent performance
4. WHEN ingesting knowledge THEN the system SHALL provide CLI tools to process and index documents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want agents to maintain conversation context, so that I can have multi-turn interactions and build upon previous queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a conversation THEN the system SHALL initialize persistent state management
2. WHEN processing subsequent queries THEN the system SHALL access and utilize previous conversation context
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL reference previously computed results when relevant
4. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and optionally save conversation history
